One use for this command is when a disk cannot be unmounted because (unspecified) files are in use. The listing of open files can be consulted (suitably filtered if necessary) to identify the process that is using the files.\n\n**see open ports**\n\n```bash\nsudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN\nsudo lsof -i:22 #see a specific port such as 22\nlsof -a -i -s TCP:SYN_RECV\n[lsof - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lsof)\n```\n\n## Count\n\n```bash\nls -l <folder> | wc -l  (Count number of files in a directory)\nfind . -type f | wc -l  (Count number of files in a directory recursively)\nwc - l file.txt (lines)\nwc -w file.txt (words)\n```\n\n### Head (Show the top 2 lines in the file)\n\n`$ head -n 2 adult.data`\n\n### Tail (Show the last lines in the file)\n\n`$ tail -n 10 adult.data`\n\n### Finding duplicates with uniq\n\nWith theuniqcommand you can find adjacent repeated lines in a file.uniqtakes several flags, the more useful ones being:\n\n- uniq -c: which adds the repetition count to each line;\n- uniq -d: which only outputs duplicate lines; And\n- uniq -u: which only outputs unique lines.\n\nHowever, uniqis not a smart command. Repeated lines will not be detected if they are not adjacent. Which means that you first need thesortthe file. This command counts the number of duplicated lines inadult.csv.\n\n`$ sort adult.csv | uniq -d | wc -l`\n\n23\n\nand shows that there are 23 duplicates. The next command takes the output of all lines with added repetition counts, sorts in reverse and outputs the first 3 duplicates:\n\n```bash\n$ sort adult.csv | uniq -c | sort -r | head -n 3\n3 25, Private, 195994, 1st-4th, 2, Never-married, ...\n2 90, Private, 52386, Some-college, 10, Never-married, ...\n2 49, Self-emp-not-inc, 43479, Some-college, 10, Married-civ-spouse, ...\n```\n\n### Hexdump\n\n```bash\n$ cat test.txt\nhi\n\n$ hexdump test.txt\n0000000 68 69\n\nHere 68 is 'h' in ASCII and 69 is 'i' in ASCII\n```\n\n## Source\n\n[source](http://ss64.com/bash/source.html) is a bash shell built-in command that executes the content of the file passed as argument, ***in the current shell***. It has a synonym in.(period).\n\n`source ~/.bash_profile`\n\n`. ~/.bash_profile`\n\n## Make\n\n### BitBake\n\nBitBakeis a [make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software))-like [build tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_tool) with the special focus of [distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distributions) and packages for [embedded Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_Linux)[cross compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_compilation), although it is not limited to that. It is inspired by [Portage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portage_(software)), which is the [package management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_management_system) used by the [Gentoo Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentoo_Linux) distribution. BitBake existed for some time in the [OpenEmbedded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenEmbedded) project until it was separated out into a standalone, maintained, distribution-independent tool. BitBake is co-maintained by the [Yocto Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yocto_Project) and the [OpenEmbedded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenEmbedded) project\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitBake>\n\n### Add new user\n\n`useradd username`\n\n### Change current user\n\n```bash\nsu username\nsudo -u telegraf /bin/bash\n```\n\n### See current user\n\n`whoami`\n\n## Seq command\n\nprint sequences of number\n\n`seq [-w] [-f format] [-s string] [-t string] [first [incr]] last`\n\n## Netstat command (list open ports)\n\n```bash\nnetstat -a #list all network ports\nnetstat -at #list all TCP Ports\nnetstat -s #show statistics for all ports\nnetstat -atn           # For tcp\nnetstat -aun           # For udp\nnetstat -atun          # For both\nnetstat -an | grep :9105 | grep -v TIME_WAIT | wc -l\nnetstat -an | grep :9105 | grep ESTABLISHED | wc -l\nsudo netstat -planet | grep 1883 | wc -l\n```\n\n## nslookup command\n\nA network utility program used to obtain information about internet servers\n\n```bash\nnslookup -query=mx google.com #Query Mail Exchanger Record\nnslookup -type=ns google.com #Query Name Server\nnslookup -type=any google.com #Query DNS Record\nnslookup -type=soa google.com #Query Start of Authority\nnslookup kafka0.zenatix.com\n```\n\n## dig command\n\nA dig is a tool for querying DNS nameservers for information about host addresses, mail exchanges, nameservers and related information\n\n```bash\ndig google.com +nocomments #turn off comment lines\ndig google.com +noauthority #turn off authority section\ndig google.com +noall #disable all section at once\ndig +trace www.google.com\ndig @8.8.8.8 +trace github.com\ndig @ns-421.awsdns-52.com github.com\ndig -x 172.217.167.132 #will do a reverse lookup, doesn't always work -- it depends on there being an accurate PTR record\n```\n\n### uptime\n\nshow how long system has been running\n\nThe uptime utility displays the current time, the length of time the system has been up, the number of users, and the load average of the system over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes.\n\n### w\n\nCombination of uptime and who commands given one immediately after the other, in that order\n\n### sort\n\nUnix Sort uses an External R-Way merge sorting algorithm.

It is useful for maintaining multiple copies of a file in many places at once without using up storage for the ``copies''; instead, a link``points'' to the original copy. There are two types of links; hard links and symbolic links. How a link ``points'' to a file is one of the differences between a hard and symbolic link.\n\n`ln -s /bin/zsh /usr/local/bin/zsh` #create a symbolic link\n\n### find\n\n```bash\nfind . -name \"zookeeper*\"\n\n# ignore case\nfind . -iname \"ipify*\"\n\n# find and delete\nfind . -name \"*.pyc\" -type f\nfind . -name \"*.pyc\" -type f -delete\n\nfind . -type f -mtime +30 -exec -f {} \\;\n\n# find and replace in shole directory except 'config.yaml'\nfind ./ ! -name 'config.yaml' -type f -exec sed -i \"s~${ecr_name}.*$~${ecr_name}\\\\/${app_name}\\\\/${env_name}:${app_name}-${env_name}-${timestamp}-${build_no}~\" {} \\;\n\nfind -E . -regex '.*hello[^/]*' -type f\nfind AI -regex '.*/[^a-zA-Z].*'\nfind . -regex '.*/[^a-zA-Z0-9.].*' -not -path \"*/node_modules/*\" -not -path  \"*/.git/*\"\n\n# rename file, replace - with -\n# brew install rename\nfind . -name \"*---*.md\" -exec rename 's/---/-/' {} \";\"\nfind . -name \"*,*.md\" -exec rename 's/,//' {} \";\"\n\nfind . -name '*.md' -exec rename .md .mdx {} +\n\n# rename file extension recursively\nfind content -type f -name '*.md' -print0 | xargs -0 rename 's/.md$/.mdx/'\n```\n\n### hostname\n\n```bash\nhostname -- set or print name of current host system\nhostname -i #server\nhostname #mac\n```\n\n### environments\n\n```bash\nprintenv | less #print all loaded environment variables\necho $<VARIABLE> #print value for environment variable\necho $? #print last call execution return value\nenv #print all environments loaded in current session\n```\n\n### tr (translate characters)\n\nThe tr utility copies the standard input to the standard output with substitution or deletion of selected characters.\n\n```bash\ncat domains.txt | tr [:lower:] [:upper:]\ncat linux.txt | tr [a-z] [A-Z]\n```\n\n<https://www.tecmint.com/tr-command-examples-in-linux>\n\n### tcpdump (wireshark)\n\n`sudo tcpdump -i any port 9101 -w tcpdump`\n\n### sed\n\n```bash\nsed -i '' 's+telegraf:.*+telegraf:x:0:0::/etc/telegraf:/bin/false+g' passwd #on macos\nsed -i 's+telegraf:.*+telegraf:x:0:0::/etc/telegraf:/bin/false+g' passwd #on unix\n\nfind ./ ! -name 'config.yaml' -type f -exec sed -i \"s~${ecr_name}.*$~${ecr_name}\\\\/${app_name}\\\\/${env_name}:${app_name}-${env_name}-${timestamp}-${build_no}~\" {} \\;\n\nfind ./ ! -name 'config.yaml' -type f -exec sed -i \"s~\n331916247734.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/loan-tape-etl/prod:loan-tape-etl-prod-2020-08-07-20-10\n$~331916247734.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/loan-tape-etl/prod:loan-tape-etl-prod-test~\" {} \\;\n```\n\n### killall\n\nkill processes by name\n\nThe killall utility kills processes selected by name, as opposed to the selection by pid as done by kill(1). By default, it will send a TERM signal to all processes with a real UID identical to the caller of killall that match the name procname. The super-user is allowed to kill any process.\n\n- The program gets sent a SIGTERM signal. kill -9 sends a SIGKILL signal\n- CTRL-C\n\nThe program gets sent a SIGINT signal. By default that stops the program immediately, but the program can choose to ignore the signal or do something else before quitting\n\n- Is it possible for a program to ignore a SIGKILL signal\n\nPrograms can't ignore SIGKILL.\n\n```bash\nkillall kubectl\nkillall -v kubectl\n\n# forcefully terminate all running processes except login shell, init, and kernel-specific processes.\nkillall5 -9\n```\n\n## openssl\n\n```bash\nopenssl rand -hex 16\nopenssl rand -hex 32\nopenssl rand -base64 32 #base64 encoded password generation\nopenssl base64 -in samhi.log -out samhi1_64.log\n\n# creating a self-signed certificate\nopenssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -nodes -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt -subj \"/CN=example.com\" -days 365\n\nopenssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048\n\nopenssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca.key -sha256 -subj \"/CN=sampleissuer.local\" -days 1024 -out ca.crt -extensions v3_ca -config openssl-with-ca.cnf\n```\n\n### public private key pair\n\nYou can generate a public-private keypair with thegenrsacontext (the last number is the keylength in bits):\n\n```bash\nopenssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048\n\n# To extract the public part, use the rsa context:\n  openssl rsa -in keypair.pem -out publickey.crt -pubout\n  openssl rsa -in key.pem -out key.pub -pubout\n\n# Finally, convert the original keypair to PKCS#8 format with the pkcs8 context:\n  openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -nocrypt -in keypair.pem -out pkcs8.key\n\n# Encrypt and Decrypt a file (using public key to encrypt)\n  echo --pass-- > pass.txt\n  openssl rsautl -in pass.txt -out pass.enc -pubin -inkey key.pub -encrypt\n  openssl rsautl -in pass.enc -out pass.dec -inkey key.pem -decrypt\n  cat pass.dec\n\n# Compress, Encrypt, Decyrpt, Uncompress a file (using password in pass.txt)\n  echo content > file.txt # overwrite file with content\n  echo content >> file.txt # append content to file.txt\n  gzip file.txt\n  openssl bf -in file.txt.gz -out file.enc -pass file:pass.txt -e\n  openssl bf -in file.enc -out file.dec.gz -pass file:pass.dec -d\n  gzip -d file.dec.gz\n  cat file.dec\n```\n\n### ts\n\nopenssl-ts, ts - Time Stamping Authority tool (client/server)\n\nThe ts command is a basic Time Stamping Authority (TSA) client and server application as specified in RFC 3161 (Time-Stamp Protocol, TSP). A TSA can be part of a PKI deployment and its role is to provide long term proof of the existence of a certain datum before a particular time.\n\nA convenient tool is the **ts (timestamp)** tool which is available on many systems. If the trace output is piped to this command each line is prefixed with a timestamp.\n\n### ps\n\nreport a snapshot of the current processes.\n\n```bash\n# get minor page fault, major page fault\nps -eo min_flt,maj_flt,cmd\n\nps -eaf\n\nps aux / auxf (tree view)\nps aux --sort=-%mem\n  • The a option tells ps the display the processes of all users, with except those processes that not associated with a terminal and processes of group leaders.\n  • The u stands for a user-oriented format which provides detailed information about the processes.\n  • The x option will case ps to list the processes without a controlling terminal. Those are mainly processes that are started on boot time and running in the background.\n\n  • PID - The process ID. In most situations when running the ps command the most important information the user is looking for is the process PID. Knowing the PID allows you to kill a malfunctioning process.\n  • TTY - The name of the controlling terminal for the process.\n  • TIME - The cumulative CPU time of the process, shown in minutes and seconds.\n  • CMD - The name of the command that was used to start the process.\n  • USER - The user who runs the process.\n  • %CPU - The process cpu utilization.\n  • %MEM - The percentage of the process’s resident set size to the physical memory on the machine.\n  • VSZ - Virtual memory size of the process in KiB.\n  • RSS - The size of the physical memory that the process is using.\n  • STAT - The the process state code, which can be Z (zombie), S (sleeping), R(running) ..etc\n  • START - The time when the command started.\n\nps $$\nOutput the shell that is running\n```\n\n<https://linuxize.com/post/ps-command-in-linux>\n\n### tree\n\nlist contents of directories in a tree-like format\n\n`tree -L 2`\n\n### /usr/bin/time\n\nrun programs and summarize system resource usage\n\n### time\n\nShell command for given shell statistics\n\n### Compression\n\n```bash\ntar -czvf all.tar.gz error.log.* (gzip all files together in a directory)\ntar -xzvf all.tar.gz -C /tmp (unzip all files to particular location)\n\ntar -xzvf all.tar.gz (unzip all files at current location)\ntar -c <directory> -xvf all.tar.gz\ntar -xvf all.tar.xz (unzip xz files)\ngzip -d <file>.gz   #unzip gz file\n\n!tar --exclude='*.csv' --exclude='__pycache__' --exclude='.ipynb_checkpoints' --exclude='*.json' --exclude='*.xml' --exclude='*.pdf' --exclude='*.pkl' -zcvf backup.tar.gz *\n!find . -name \"*.ipynb\" -o -name \"*.py\" | tar -zcvf backup.tar.gz -T -\n\n!find . -name \"*.ipynb\" -o -name \"*.py\" | tar -zcvf backup-ipynb-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz -T -\ntar -zcvf backup-ipynb-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz folder_to_zip\n\ntar -zcf backup-ipynb-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).tar.gz folder_to_zip   # no output - without v\n\nbrew install rar\n  unrar x.rar\n```\n\n### df - report file system disk space usage\n\nThere might come a situation while using Linux when you want to know the amount of space consumed by a particular file system on your LINUX system or how much space is available on a particular file system.\n\n`df -h, --human-readable`\n\n### du (disk usage) - estimate file space usage\n\nThe du command can be used to track the files and directories which are consuming excessive amount of space on hard disk drive.\n\n```bash\ndu -h, --human-readable\n\n# depth = 1\ndu -h -d 1\n\nTo list the largest directories from the current directory in human readable format, with retricting number of rows\ndu -sh * | sort -hr | head -n10\n\ndu -sh file_path\nExplanation\n  • du (disc usage) command estimates file_path space usage\n  • The options -sh are (from man du):\n-s, --summarize\n        display only a total for each argument\n\n-h, --human-readable\n        print sizes in human readable format (e.g., 1K 234M 2G)\n\nTo check more than one directory and see the total, use du -sch:\n-c, --total\n        produce a grand total\n```\n\n## NetCat (NC)\n\nThe nc (or netcat) utility is used for just about anything under the sun involving TCP or UDP. It can open TCP connections, send UDP packets, listen on arbitrary TCP and UDP ports, do port scanning, and deal with both IPv4 and IPv6. Unlike telnet(1), nc scripts nicely, and separates error messages onto standard error instead of sending them to standard output, as telnet(1) does with some.\n\nCommon uses include:\n\n- simple TCP proxies\n- shell-script based HTTP clients and servers\n- network daemon testing\n- a SOCKS or HTTP ProxyCommand for ssh(1)\n\n`nc -l 8000 -u`\n\n## strace\n\ntrace system calls and signals\n\nIn the simplest casestraceruns the specifiedcommanduntil it exits. It intercepts and records the system calls which are called by a process and the signals which are received by a process. The name of each system call, its arguments and its return value are printed on standard error or to the file specified with the-ooption.\n\nstraceis a useful diagnostic, instructional, and debugging tool. System administrators, diagnosticians and trouble-shooters will find it invaluable for solving problems with programs for which the source is not readily available since they do not need to be recompiled in order to trace them. Students, hackers and the overly-curious will find that a great deal can be learned about a system and its system calls by tracing even ordinary programs. And programmers will find that since system calls and signals are events that happen at the user/kernel interface, a close examination of this boundary is very useful for bug isolation, sanity checking and attempting to capture race conditions.\n\nMacOS - dtrace\n\n<https://linux.die.net/man/1/strace>\n\n<https://8thlight.com/blog/colin-jones/2015/11/06/dtrace-even-better-than-strace-for-osx.html>\n\n## nice/renice\n\nWhile the nice command lets you execute a program/process with modified scheduling priority, the renice command allows you to change the scheduling priority of an already running process. Following is the generic syntax forboth these commands:\n\n`nice [OPTION] [COMMAND [ARG]...]`\n\n`renice [-n] priority [[-p] pid ...] [[-g] pgrp ...] [[-u] user ...]`\n\n### Nice\n\nRun COMMAND with an adjusted niceness, which affects process scheduling. With no COMMAND, print the current niceness. Niceness values range from -20 (most favorable to the process) to 19 (least favorable to the process).\n\n### Renice\n\nRenice alters the scheduling priority of one or more running processes. The following who parameters are interpreted as process ID's, process group ID's, or user names. Renice'ing a process group causes all processes in the process group to have their scheduling priority altered. Renice'ing a user causes all processes owned by the user to have their scheduling priority altered. By default, the processes to be affected are specified by their process ID's.\n\n<https://www.howtoforge.com/linux-nice-command>\n\n## nohup\n\nThe nohup utility invokes utility with its arguments and at this time sets the signal SIGHUP to be ignored. If the standard output is a terminal, the standard output is appended to the file nohup.out in the current directory. If standard error is a terminal, it is directed to the same place as the standard output.\n\nIf you use thenohupcommand, you can continue processing even if you log out of the terminal.\n\n`nohup jupyter notebook &`\n\n## sample\n\nProfile a process during a time interval\n\nsample is a command-line tool for gathering data about the running behavior of a process. It suspends the process at specified intervals (by default, every 1 millisecond), records the call stacks of all threads in the process at that time, then resumes the process. The analysis done by sample is called ``sampling'' because it only checks the state of the program at the sampling points. The analysis may miss execution of some functions that are not executing during one of the samples, but sample still provides useful data about commonly executing functions.\n\nAt the end of the sampling duration, sample produces a report showing which functions were executing during the sampling. The data is condensed into a call tree, showing the functions seen on the stack and how they were called. (This tree is a subset of the actual call tree for the execution, since some functions may not have been executing during any of the sampling events.) The tree is displayed textually, with called functions indented one level to the right of the callee.\n\nIn the call tree, if a function calls more than one function then a vertical line is printed to visually connect those separate children functions, making it easier to see which functions are at the same level. The characters used to draw those lines, such as + | : ! are arbitrary and have no specific meaning.\n\n## Others\n\n```bash\n1. !! / sudo !! (repeat last command with sudo)\n2. pwd (Print working Directory)\n3. xrandr -o normal (Screen rotation)\n4. sudo shred -n 1 -v -z /dev/sd (format full hard disk, first write random bits, than with zeros, to every address)\n5. bash install-missing.sh (running set of bash commands from a file)\n6. wc “file”                 //count number of lines/words/characters in file\n7. banner <anything>    #prints a banner for <anything>\n8  file [path] #to check the type of file\n```\n\n## taskset\n\ntasksetis used to set or retrieve the CPU affinity of a running process given its PID or to launch a new COMMAND with a given CPU affinity. CPU affinity is a scheduler property that \"bonds\" a process to a given set of CPUs on the system. The Linux scheduler will honor the given CPU affinity and the process will not run on any other CPUs. Note that the Linux scheduler also supports natural CPU affinity: the scheduler attempts to keep processes on the same CPU as long as practical for performance reasons. Therefore, forcing a specific CPU affinity is useful only in certain applications.\n\nThe CPU affinity is represented as a bitmask, with the lowest order bit corresponding to the first logical CPU and the highest order bit corresponding to the last logical CPU. Not all CPUs may exist on a given system but a mask may specify more CPUs than are present. A retrieved mask will reflect only the bits that correspond to CPUs physically on the system. If an invalid mask is given (i.e., one that corresponds to no valid CPUs on the current system) an error is returned. The masks are typically given in hexadecimal.
