supports these password-management capabilities:\n\n- Password expiration, to require passwords to be changed periodically.\n- Password reuse restrictions, to prevent old passwords from being chosen again.\n- Password verification, to require that password changes also specify the current password to be replaced.\n- **Dual passwords**, to enable clients to connect using either a primary or secondary password.\n- Password strength assessment, to require strong passwords.\n- Random password generation, as an alternative to requiring explicit administrator-specified literal passwords.\n- Password failure tracking, to enable temporary account locking after too many consecutive incorrect-password login failures.\n<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-security-excerpt/8.0/en/password-management.html>\n6.2.12 Server Handling of Expired Passwords\n\n6.2.13 Pluggable Authentication\n\n6.2.14 Proxy Users\n\n6.2.15 Account Locking\n\n## 6.2.16 Setting Account Resource Limits\n\nOne means of restricting client use of MySQL server resources is to set the global [max_user_connections](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_max_user_connections) system variable to a nonzero value. This limits the number of simultaneous connections that can be made by any given account, but places no limits on what a client can do once connected. In addition, setting [max_user_connections](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_max_user_connections) does not enable management of individual accounts. Both types of control are of interest to MySQL administrators.\nTo address such concerns, MySQL permits limits for individual accounts on use of these server resources:\n\n- The number of queries an account can issue per hour\n- The number of updates an account can issue per hour\n- The number of times an account can connect to the server per hour\n- The number of simultaneous connections to the server by an account\n<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/user-resources.html>\n6.2.17 Troubleshooting Problems Connecting to MySQL\n\n6.2.18 SQL-Based Account Activity Auditing\n\n6.3 Using Encrypted Connections\n\n6.3.1 Configuring MySQL to Use Encrypted Connections\n\n6.3.2 Encrypted Connection TLS Protocols and Ciphers\n\n6.3.3 Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys\n\n6.3.4 SSL Library-Dependent Capabilities\n\n6.3.5 Connecting to MySQL Remotely from Windows with SSH\n\n6.4 Security Plugins\n\n6.4.1 Authentication Plugins\n\n6.4.2 The Connection-Control Plugins\n\n6.4.3 The Password Validation Plugin\n\n6.4.4 The MySQL Keyring\n\n6.4.5 MySQL Enterprise Audit\n\n6.4.6 MySQL Enterprise Firewall\n\n6.4.7 MySQL Enterprise Data Masking and De-Identification\n\n7 Backup and Recovery\n\n7.1 Backup and Recovery Types\n\n7.2 Database Backup Methods\n\n7.3 Example Backup and Recovery Strategy\n\n7.3.1 Establishing a Backup Policy\n\n7.3.2 Using Backups for Recovery\n\n7.3.3 Backup Strategy Summary\n\n7.4 Using mysqldump for Backups\n\n7.4.1 Dumping Data in SQL Format with mysqldump\n\n7.4.2 Reloading SQL-Format Backups\n\n7.4.3 Dumping Data in Delimited-Text Format with mysqldump\n\n7.4.4 Reloading Delimited-Text Format Backups\n\n7.4.5 mysqldump Tips\n\n7.5 Point-in-Time (Incremental) Recovery Using the Binary Log\n\n7.5.1 Point-in-Time Recovery Using Event Times\n\n7.5.2 Point-in-Time Recovery Using Event Positions\n\n7.6 MyISAM Table Maintenance and Crash Recovery\n\n7.6.1 Using myisamchk for Crash Recovery\n\n7.6.2 How to Check MyISAM Tables for Errors\n\n7.6.3 How to Repair MyISAM Tables\n\n7.6.4 MyISAM Table Optimization\n\n7.6.5 Setting Up a MyISAM Table Maintenance Schedule\n\n8 Optimization\n\n8.1 Optimization Overview\n\n8.2 Optimizing SQL Statements\n\n8.2.1 Optimizing SELECT Statements\n\n8.2.2 Optimizing Subqueries, Derived Tables, and View References\n\n8.2.3 Optimizing INFORMATION_SCHEMA Queries\n\n8.2.4 Optimizing Data Change Statements\n\n8.2.5 Optimizing Database Privileges\n\n8.2.6 Other Optimization Tips\n\n8.3 Optimization and Indexes\n\n8.3.1 How MySQL Uses Indexes\n\n8.3.2 Primary Key Optimization\n\n8.3.3 Foreign Key Optimization\n\n8.3.4 Column Indexes\n\n8.3.5 Multiple-Column Indexes\n\n8.3.6 Verifying Index Usage\n\n8.3.7 InnoDB and MyISAM Index Statistics Collection\n\n8.3.8 Comparison of B-Tree and Hash Indexes\n\n8.3.9 Use of Index Extensions\n\n8.3.10 Optimizer Use of Generated Column Indexes\n\n8.3.11 Indexed Lookups from TIMESTAMP Columns\n\n8.4 Optimizing Database Structure\n\n8.4.1 Optimizing Data Size\n\n8.4.2 Optimizing MySQL Data Types\n\n8.4.3 Optimizing for Many Tables\n\n8.4.4 Internal Temporary Table Use in MySQL\n\n8.4.5 Limits on Number of Databases and Tables\n\n8.4.6 Limits on Table Size\n\n8.4.7 Limits on Table Column Count and Row Size\n\n- MySQL has hard limit of 4096 columns per table, but the effective maximum may be less for a given table.\n- [InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-storage-engine.html) has a limit of 1017 columns per table.\n- The internal representation of a MySQL table has a maximum row size limit of 65,535 bytes\n\n<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/column-count-limit.html>\n\n8.5 Optimizing for InnoDB Tables\n\n8.5.1 Optimizing Storage Layout for InnoDB Tables\n\n8.5.2 Optimizing InnoDB Transaction Management\n\n8.5.3 Optimizing InnoDB Read-Only Transactions\n\n8.5.4 Optimizing InnoDB Redo Logging\n\n8.5.5 Bulk Data Loading for InnoDB Tables\n\n8.5.6 Optimizing InnoDB Queries\n\n8.5.7 Optimizing InnoDB DDL Operations\n\n8.5.8 Optimizing InnoDB Disk I/O\n\n8.5.9 Optimizing InnoDB Configuration Variables\n\n8.5.10 Optimizing InnoDB for Systems with Many Tables\n\n8.6 Optimizing for MyISAM Tables\n\n8.6.1 Optimizing MyISAM Queries\n\n8.6.2 Bulk Data Loading for MyISAM Tables\n\n8.6.3 Optimizing REPAIR TABLE Statements\n\n8.7 Optimizing for MEMORY Tables\n\n8.8 Understanding the Query Execution Plan\n\n8.8.1 Optimizing Queries with EXPLAIN\n\n8.8.2 EXPLAIN Output Format\n\n8.8.3 Extended EXPLAIN Output Format\n\n8.8.4 Obtaining Execution Plan Information for a Named Connection\n\n8.8.5 Estimating Query Performance\n\n8.9 Controlling the Query Optimizer\n\n8.9.1 Controlling Query Plan Evaluation\n\n8.9.2 Switchable Optimizations\n\n8.9.3 Optimizer Hints\n\n8.9.4 Index Hints\n\n8.9.5 The Optimizer Cost Model\n\nTo generate execution plans, the optimizer uses a cost model that is based on estimates of the cost of various operations that occur during query execution. The optimizer has a set of compiled-in default\"cost constants\" available to it to make decisions regarding execution plans.\n<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/cost-model.html>\n8.10 Buffering and Caching\n\n8.10.1 InnoDB Buffer Pool Optimization\n\n8.10.2 The MyISAM Key Cache\n\n8.10.3 The MySQL Query Cache\n\n8.10.4 Caching of Prepared Statements and Stored Programs\n\n## 8.11 Optimizing Locking Operations\n\n- Internal locking is performed within the MySQL server itself to manage contention for table contents by multiple threads. This type of locking is internal because it is performed entirely by the server and involves no other programs.\n- External locking occurs when the server and other programs lock [MyISAM](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/myisam-storage-engine.html) table files to coordinate among themselves which program can access the tables at which time.\n8.11.1 Internal Locking Methods\n\nMySQL uses [**row-level locking**](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/glossary.html#glos_row_lock) forInnoDBtables to support simultaneous write access by multiple sessions, making them suitable for multi-user, highly concurrent, and OLTP applications.\n\nTo avoid [deadlocks](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/glossary.html#glos_deadlock) when performing multiple concurrent write operations on a singleInnoDBtable, acquire necessary locks at the start of the transaction by issuing aSELECT ... FOR UPDATEstatement for each group of rows expected to be modified, even if the data change statements come later in the transaction. If transactions modify or lock more than one table, issue the applicable statements in the same order within each transaction. Deadlocks affect performance rather than representing a serious error, becauseInnoDBautomatically [detects](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/glossary.html#glos_deadlock_detection) deadlock conditions and rolls back one of the affected transactions.\n\nOn high concurrency systems, **deadlock detection can cause a slowdown when numerous threads wait for the same lock.** At times, it may be **more efficient to disable deadlock detection and rely on the [innodb_lock_wait_timeout](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_lock_wait_timeout) setting for transaction rollback** when a deadlock occurs. Deadlock detection can be disabled using the [innodb_deadlock_detect](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_deadlock_detect) configuration option.\n\nAdvantages of row-level locking:\n\n- Fewer lock conflicts when different sessions access different rows.\n- Fewer changes for rollbacks.\n- Possible to lock a single row for a long time.\nMySQL uses

Subqueries\n\n13.2.11 UPDATE Statement\n\n13.3 Transactional and Locking Statements\n\n13.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements\n\nInInnoDB, all user activity occurs inside a transaction. If [autocommit](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_autocommit) mode is enabled, each SQL statement forms a single transaction on its own. By default, MySQL starts the session for each new connection with [autocommit](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_autocommit) enabled, so MySQL does a commit after each SQL statement if that statement did not return an error. If a statement returns an error, the commit or rollback behavior depends on the error. See [Section15.21.4, \"InnoDB Error Handling\"](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-error-handling.html).\nA session that has [autocommit](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_autocommit) enabled can perform a multiple-statement transaction by starting it with an explicit [START TRANSACTION](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/commit.html) or [BEGIN](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/commit.html) statement and ending it with a [COMMIT](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/commit.html) or [ROLLBACK](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/commit.html) statement. See [Section13.3.1, \"START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements\"](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/commit.html).\nIf [autocommit](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_autocommit) mode is disabled within a session withSET autocommit = 0, the session always has a transaction open. A [COMMIT](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/commit.html) or [ROLLBACK](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/commit.html) statement ends the current transaction and a new one starts.\nIf a session that has [autocommit](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_autocommit) disabled ends without explicitly committing the final transaction, MySQL rolls back that transaction.\nSome statements implicitly end a transaction, as if you had done a [COMMIT](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/commit.html) before executing the statement. For details, see [Section13.3.3, \"Statements That Cause an Implicit Commit\"](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/implicit-commit.html).\n\nA [COMMIT](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/commit.html) means that the changes made in the current transaction are made permanent and become visible to other sessions. A [ROLLBACK](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/commit.html) statement, on the other hand, cancels all modifications made by the current transaction. Both [COMMIT](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/commit.html) and [ROLLBACK](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/commit.html) release allInnoDBlocks that were set during the current transaction.\n<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-autocommit-commit-rollback.html>\n13.3.2 Statements That Cannot Be Rolled Back\n\n13.3.3 Statements That Cause an Implicit

TRIGGER test.ins_sum;\nmysql> delimiter //\n\nmysql> CREATE TRIGGER upd_check BEFORE UPDATE ON account\n\n-> FOR EACH ROW\n\n-> BEGIN\n\n-> IF NEW.amount < 0 THEN\n\n-> SET NEW.amount = 0;\n\n->

a particular event occurs for the table. Some uses for triggers are to perform checks of values to be inserted into a table or to perform calculations on values involved in an update.\n\n## Does MySQL 5.6 have statement-level or row-level triggers?\n\nIn MySQL 5.6 and MySQL 8.0, all triggers areFOR EACH ROW; that is, the trigger is activated for each row that is inserted, updated, or deleted. MySQL 5.6 does not support triggers usingFOR EACH STATEMENT.\nThe SQL standard defines two types of triggers: row-level triggers and statement-level triggers.\n\n- A row-level trigger is activated for each row that is inserted, updated, or deleted. For example, if a table has 100 rows inserted, updated, or deleted, the trigger is automatically invoked 100 times for the 100 rows affected.\n- A statement-level trigger is executed once for each transaction regardless of how many rows are inserted, updated, or deleted.\nMySQL supports only row-level triggers. It doesn't support statement-level triggers.\n<https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-triggers.aspx>\n\n## When to use and not to use Triggers\n\nTriggers are a requirement for any complex data integrity rules. These cannot be enforced anywhere except the database or you will have data integrity problems.\nThey are also the best place for auditing unless you don't want to capture all changes to the database (which is the problem of auditing from the application).\nTriggers can cause performance issues if not written carefully and not enough developers are knowledgeable enough to write them well. This is part of where they get their bad rap.\nTriggers are often slower than other means of maintaining data integrity, so if you can use a check constraint, use that instead of a trigger.\nIt is easy to write bad triggers that do stupid things like try to send emails. Do you really want to be unable to change records in the db if the email server goes down?\nIn SQL server, triggers operate on a batch of records. All too often developers think they only need to handle one record inserts, updates or deletes. That is not the only kind of data changes that happen to a database and all triggers should be tested under the conditions of 1 record change and many record changes. Forgetting to do the second test can lead to extremely poorly performing triggers or a loss of data integrity.\n\n## Use of database triggers\n\n1. To drive column values automatically.\n\n2. To enforce complex integrity constraints.\n\n3. To enforce complex business rules.\n\n4. To customize complex security authorizations.\n\n5. To maintain replicate tables.\n\n6. To audit data modification.\n\n## Different Types of Triggers\n\nA MySQLtriggeris a stored program (with queries) which is executed automatically to respond to a specific event such as insertion, updation or deletion occurring in a table.\nThere are 6 different types of triggers in MySQL:\n\n1. Before Update Trigger\n\n2. After Update Trigger\n\n3. Before Insert Trigger\n\n4. After Insert Trigger\n\n5. Before Delete Trigger\n\n6. After Delete Trigger\n<https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/different-types-of-mysql-triggers-with-examples>\n23.3.1 Trigger Syntax and Examples\n\n23.3.2 Trigger Metadata\n\n23.4 Using the Event Scheduler\n\nMySQL Events are tasks that run according to a schedule. Therefore, we sometimes refer to them as *scheduled*events. When you create an event, you are creating a named database object containing one or more SQL statements to be executed at one or more regular intervals, beginning and ending at a specific date and time. Conceptually, this is similar to the idea of the Unixcrontab(also known as a\"cron job\") or the Windows Task Scheduler.\n<https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-triggers/working-mysql-scheduled-event>\n\n<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/events-overview.html>\n23.4.1 Event Scheduler Overview\n\n23.4.2
