There is literally no difference.\n- Multiple studies have compared eating many smaller versus fewer larger meals and concluded that there is no significant effect on either metabolic rate or the total amount of fat lost\n- Fewer and larger meals lower your average daily blood sugar levels. Getting most of your calories in the morning and eating fewer in the afternoon and evening also seems to reduce average blood sugar levels.\n- Skipping meals every now and then helps you lose weight and may improve your blood sugar control over time.\n\n![image](media/Nutrition_Food-image1.png)\n\n## Food Pyramid\n\n![image](media/Nutrition_Food-image2.png)\n\n## Grains: Make half your grain whole. Eat at least 3 oz. of whole grain cereals, breads, crackers, rice, or pasta every day\n\n## Vegetables: Vary your vegetables. Eat more dark green veg- etables like broccoli and spinach. Eat more orange vegetables like carrots and sweet potatoes. Eat more dry beans and peas\n\n## Fruits: Eat a variety of fruits. Choose fresh, frozen, canned, or dried fruit. Go easy on fruit juices, which have high sugar content without much fiber\n\n## Milk: Eat calcium-rich foods. Choose low-fat or fat-free dairy products. If you don't drink milk or eat dairy products, choose lactose-free products or other calcium sources such as fortified foods and drinks\n\n## Meat and beans: Eat lean proteins. Choose low-fat or lean cuts of meat and poultry. Bake, broil, or grill your meats. Eat more fish, beans, peas, nuts, and seeds\n\n![image](media/Nutrition_Food-image3.png)\n\n[How We Got the Science of Weight Loss Wrong - with Giles Yeo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQJ0Z0DRumg&ab_channel=TheRoyalInstitution)\n\n- Protein - 16% of your daily energy intake\n- Fibre > 30 grams per day\n- Free sugar < 5 per cent of your daily energy intake\n- Meat - free days\n\n## Vegetables\n\n- Daikon, White Radish - Mooli\n\n<https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/list-of-vegetables>\n\n## Eight principles of low-glycemic eating\n\n1. Eat a lot of non-starchy vegetables, beans, and fruits such as apples, pears, peaches, and berries. Even tropi- cal fruits like bananas, mangoes, and papayas tend to have a lower glycemic index than typical desserts\n\n2. Eat grains in the least-processed state possible: \"unbroken,\" such as whole-kernel bread, brown rice, and whole barley, millet, and wheat berries; or tra- ditionally processed, such as stone-ground bread, steel-cut oats, and natural granola or muesli breakfast cereals\n\n3. Limit white potatoes and refined grain products such as white breads and white pasta to small side dishes.\n\n4. Limit concentrated sweets - including high-calorie foods with a low glycemic index, such as ice cream - to occasional treats. Reduce fruit juice to no more than one cup a day. Completely eliminate sugar-sweetened drinks\n\n5. Eat a healthful type of protein, such as beans, fish, or skinless chicken, at most meals\n\n6. Choose healthful fats, such as olive oil, nuts (almonds, walnuts, pecans), and avocados. Limit saturated fats from dairy and other animal products. Completely eliminate partially hydrogenated fats (trans fats), which are in fast food and many packaged foods\n\n7. Have three meals and one or two snacks each day, and don't skip breakfast\n\n8. Eat slowly and stop when full\n\n<http://hrccatalog.hrrh.on.ca/InmagicGenie/DocumentFolder/healthy%20eating.pdf>\n\n[Fed Up 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y647tNm8nTI)\n\nSmooth, bright, seedless, conveniently wrapped; the banana is the original fast food\n\n## Milk\n\n- Cow's Milk\n- Almond Milk\n- **Soy Milk (best for planet)**\n- **Oat Milk (best for planet)**\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6TXDFp1EcM>\n\n## Fruits\n\n![image](media/Nutrition_Food-image4.jpeg)\n\n## Vitamins\n\nThey decide how our skin looks. How strong our bones are. How we fight infections. Whether we wake up happy or grumpy. Vitamins wield immense power over our bodies and minds. What’s more, Bigbasketeer, vitamin deficiencies can have some pretty serious consequences. Reason enough to take a closer look at them?\n\nVitamins are...\n\n1. A group of compounds\n\n    There are 13 vitamins in all: A, C, D, E, K, and the B-complex of 8 vitamins\n\n2. Micronutrients\n\n    We need them in tiny quantities (milli or micrograms). Unlike carbs/proteins, which are macronutrients.\n\n3. Essential nutrients\n\n    They’re not produced directly by our bodies but supplied from our food (with a few exceptions.)\n\n#### Vitamin supplements: Good or Bad?\n\nWhen it comes to vitamins, there is such a thing as too much. Every vitamin has a recommended daily intake and you can get this from a healthy, diverse diet. But if you’re eating fortified foods and taking supplements (often ordered online without checking dosage or composition), you may consume more than you need.\n\nSo, unless you have a diagnosed deficiency, get your vitamins from food. There is evidence that this has better health outcomes overall!\n\n### Your guide to a vitamin-rich diet\n\n#### Vitamin A\n\nImportant for\n\n- Growth\n- Immunity\n- Skin & bone formation\n- Reproductive health\n- Eyesight\n\nGet it from\n\n- Orange/yellow produce (carrots, red capsicum, mango, papaya, pumpkin)\n- Green leafy veggies\n- Eggs\n\n#### Vitamin B Complex\n\nImportant for\n\n- Metabolism\n- DNA synthesis\n- Nervous system function\n- RBC creation\n\nGet it from\n\n- Seafood, meat & poultry\n- Eggs & dairy\n- Legumes (beans, lentils)\n- Green leafy veggies\n- Beetroot\n\n#### Vitamin C\n\nImportant for\n\n- Collagen for skin & hair\n- Immunity\n- Antioxidant properties\n\nGet it from\n\n- Citrus fruits\n- Kiwi & amla\n- Potato & tomato\n- Green leafies\n- Cruciferous veggies (cabbage, gobi, broccoli)\n\n#### Vitamin E\n\nImportant for\n\n- Skin & hair\n- Eyesight\n- Antioxidant properties\n\nGet it from\n\n- Nuts and seeds such as almonds, sunflower seeds, and peanuts\n- Egg yolks\n- Whole grains\n- Green leafy veggies\n\n#### Vitamin K\n\nImportant for\n\n- Bone health\n- Blood clotting & wound healing\n\nGet it from\n\n- Green leafy vegetables\n- Avocado\n- Kiwi\n\nWondering what happened to vitamins B4, B8, B10, and B11?
