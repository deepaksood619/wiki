By understanding that anything he assumes could easily be wrong, Soros stays alert and ready to change direction. Any time a strategy doesn't fulfill his expectations, he immediately examines what his initial assumptions were and where he might have gone wrong.\n\nIt's not easy to admit that we've made a mistake or that our initial strategy wasn't all that great. But the ability to learn from our mistakes and change direction is often what leads to great success.\n\n## Leadership isn't about influence and control. It's about trust, fairness, and leading by example\n\nAn excellent embodiment of this leadership philosophy is Max Perutz, one of the most successful scientists of the twentieth century. Perutz ran the Cavendish Laboratory, which has been awarded nine Nobel Prizes, four Orders of Merit and nine Copley Medals. The secret to his success? Perutz built a world-class lab by assuming that everyone he worked with was as ambitious, hardworking, and honest as he was. He didn't care about bureaucratic rules, hierarchies, or proving himself to his coworkers. Instead, he inspired his colleagues to be the best they could be through his own brilliance and dedication.\n\nOne of the reasons Perutz's employees trusted and admired him so much was because their work environment felt fair. There are many ways to foster a sense of fairness. One of the most effective is to borrow a philosophical principle calledthe veil of ignorance. The veil of ignorance was developed by John Rawls, probably the most famous political philosopher of the twentieth century.\n\nTo put the exercise into practice, gather your workers together and present them with a problem that needs solving. Here's the catch: They must develop a plan that feels fair to all of them, without knowing beforehand who will end up with which role and set of duties. In other words, each participant will be ready to doanyof the jobs the team creates. Great leaders will involve themselves in the process, showing their willingness to roll up their sleeves and do any of the work that their employees normally do.\n\n## Real authority promotes empowerment at all levels of an organization\n\n## To promote engagement, we need to learn to treat each other not as objects, but as people\n\n## Ethical behavior in the workplace means understanding the concept of moral plurality\n\nEvery day, leaders need to make dozens of decisions. One hopes that that decision-making is guided by a sense of morality and a desire to do what is right. If the world were cleanly divided between \"right\" and \"wrong,\" that wouldn't be so hard. Unfortunately, that's not how the world works. What makes ethical decision-making so difficult is that the real dilemma isn't about choosing between right and wrong, but about choosing between two competing \"rights.\"\n\nTake the following story, which occurred at the height of World War Two. An Allied officer received word that there had been a leak of very important information by a member of his staff. He tried his best to find out which of his secretaries had leaked it, but to no avail. Eventually, he had to choose between two \"rights.\" If he fired all of the secretaries, he would ensure there would be no more leaks, which would protect the lives of soldiers. If he fired no one, he would ensure no innocent secretary would be punished for the wrongdoing of another. There wasn't a clear right or wrong. Instead, he had to weigh the relative value of each \"right\" against the other.\n\nThere's a philosophical term for the situation the officer found himself in. It's calledmoral plurality, the idea that there isn't one single right or wrong, but a number of competing rights. The twentieth-century philosopher Isaiah Berlin was a big believer in moral plurality. He thought the idea of a perfect world where all values were harmoniously combined was impossible. In the case of the officer's situation, for instance, there was no way for him to uphold the ethic of protecting his soldiers' lives while also upholding the ethic of fair workplace conditions.\n\n## We all want to be free, but we also need to understand the responsibility that comes with freedom\n\nIt's easy to think about freedom as power. By that logic, when we're free, we're free to do whatever we want. But in actuality, freedom involves a lot of responsibility.\n\nThink about the following scenario. Mario has been tasked with designing the new website for his company, and he has been given instructions for every single component, from the colors to the banner design. His job is that of a designer, but in reality, he doesn't actually have any freedom to design. Without freedom, Mario probably feels held back, bored, and disempowered.\n\nNow let's think about the opposite situation. Mario has been given total freedom to develop the website however he wants. At first, the opportunity probably feels exciting. But then fears and doubts might creep in: If he builds a website no one likes, he has no one to blame but himself. With the freedom to create comes total responsibility for what he creates.\n\nThe lesson from this story is that freedom both allows us to feel empowered and forces us to take responsibility for our thoughts and actions, and to prepare for the possibility of being wrong or rejected. What freedom gives us is choice. How we use that opportunity is entirely up to us.\n\nOne of the most important schools of philosophy to discuss the idea of choice isexistentialism.The existentialists believed that \"existence precedes essence.\" The idea here is that we come into the world as a blank page. To live is to determine who we are entirely: we can't blame the past, our genetics, or anything outside of ourselves. As a philosophical position, it's optimistic in the sense that we get to choose who we are. But it's also challenging, because we are then given the responsibility to shape who and what we are entirely. If we succeed, that's on us. But if we fail, that's also on us.\n\nWhether you're navigating the freedom and responsibility of actualizing a milestone at work or making the difficult ethical decision about whether to fire an employee, remember that with the freedom to choose comes a lot of responsibility.\n\nGreat leaders don't treat freedom as power. They treat it as an enormous responsibility.\n\n## Actionable Advice - Strengthen your argumentative skills\n\nThe next time you think you are certain about something, run a thought experiment. Try to locate the basis of your certainty and figure out whether or not it's actually a solid foundation. Next, try to build up the logic of the counter-argument as much as you can. What have you learned by the end that you didn't know at the beginning?\n\n## Blinkist - The Squiggly Career By Helen Tupper and Sarah Ellis\n\nDitch the Ladder, Embrace Opportunity and Carve Your Own Path Through the Squiggly World of Work\n\nThe Squiggly Career(2020) covers research and tips on how to best navigate a career full of frequent transitions and modern-day challenges. If we learn to identify our own strengths, values, goals, and motivations, we can apply them more often at work -- and notice when they're being neglected. The authors reveal how to network by helping others, the merits of starting a side project, and how to make the most of the newfound control we have over our careers.\n\n- Throughout our lifetimes, most of us will spend an average of 90,000 (10 *365*40 = 146,000 according to my estimates) hours working.\n\n- Compared to previous generations, we have more freedom to decide how our careers play out.\n\nBesides glaring spelling mistakes on your resume, job-hopping used to be a surefire way to get a hiring manager to disregard your application. Nowadays, it's not only more common, but increasingly seen as a positive facet in an applicant. After all, multiple starts in your career indicate an unwillingness to settle for anything less than the best. Trying different routes suggests adaptability and open-mindedness, and it usually means you've picked up new skills and perspectives along the way.\n\nAutomation is also constantly transforming and replacing professions. According to a study by management consulting firm McKinsey & Company, as many as 375 million people might have to change their career fields in the next ten years.\n\nThree main phases in life\n\n- The first period is theimprint phase, which begins at birth and continues until we're about seven years old. Our parents, as well as others we spend time with, provide our first taste of right and wrong. For the most part, we don't challenge what we see and hear; we soak it up like a sponge.\n- The second period is the copy-cat phase, also known as the**modeling period**. From ages eight to thirteen, we start acting in various different ways, copying the behavior of people we look up to. We imitate teachers, other kids at school, or older siblings.\n- The final period is the**rebel phase**. It starts in our teenage years when we become more influenced by friends, the media, and friends of the media. We then have to iron out the friction between what we used to believe and what we now think is right.\n\n- Networking is an exchange of help, and offering to support others can lead to valuable relationships.\n\nThe quality of your network connections will always be more important than the quantity. The anthropologist and psychologist Robin Dunbar claims that we have a limited number of each friend type. According to his research, we can have a maximum of 150 casual friends. For close friends, that number is 50. For confidantes and supporters, it's 15. And we can have just 5 best friends.\n\nRather than vaguely asking someone to mentor you, be specific in your requests. For example, you could contact someone working in your desired field or position, and ask her how she got there. What skills and experience would you need to do her job?\n\n- Focus on exploring future possibilities rather than on following linear plans.\n\nIn this day and age, we're likely to change careers five times over the course of our working lives. The classic life track of \"education-work-retirement\" is rapidly going extinct.\n\nYour**obvious possibility** is the next logical step from where you are right now. If you keep doing what you're doing, where will you end up? Your**pivot possibility** is a new position that would use your skill set and super strengths in a fresh way. Your**ambitious possibility** is something you've always considered but have decided against for some reason. Usually it involves overcoming a hurdle such as a lack of experience or education. Finally, your**dream possibility** is the work you'd choose to do if you had nothing holding you back. It could be your current work, but it could also be something completely new. Perhaps you're an accountant who wants to be a pilot. Anything is possible!\n\n- Curiosity, feedback, and grit are increasingly sought-after workplace skills.\n\nStay curious to avoid tunnel vision\n\nSo how can you stay curious? The possibilities are endless. Subscribe to a magazine on a topic you know nothing about. Discover new podcasts. Talk to strangers or new acquaintances.\n\nWhen giving feedback, try using the \"what went well/even better if\" technique. In other words, first tell your colleague something positive, like \"Your presentation was really effective, and you managed to keep everyone engaged the entire time.\" Then, give your suggestions for improvement, like \"It would be even better if you gave more concrete examples to back up your claims.\"\n\n## Grit -- that is, the amount of effort you put into something -- turns out to be a better gauge of success. There are four main ways to cultivate your grit\n\nFirst, recognize what fascinates you, and explore it. Second, use deliberate practice every day to continue advancing your skills. This is the act of deciding what skill to improve, how to improve it, and then training it extensively. Third, identify a greater purpose for your goals to communicate what you wish to contribute to your organization, industry, or the world in general. Fourth, adopt a growth mindset. Simply having an attitude geared toward constantly growing and developing your mind and skills relies on your grit as fuel.\n\n- Actionable advice: Document your successes each week.\n\n## Blinkist - All you have to do is Ask - Wayne Baker\n\nHow to master the most important skill for success\n\n- Reciprocity Ring (pay it forward)\n- Psychological safety in workplace\n- Types\n  - The overly generous givers\n  - The selfish takers\n  - The loan wolves\n  - The giver requester\n\n## Blinkist - Think like an entrepreneur, act like a CEO by Beverly E.

It is the one of the first evidence of law ever written down. One ofthe principle features of the code was about the builder - If a builder built a house for a man & the house collapses to cause the death of the owner, then the builder has to be put to death.\n\n## Skin in the Game by Nassim Nicholas Taleb\n\n[Skin In The Game](https://amzn.to/2IJkhFE) is an assessment of asymmetries in human interactions, aimed at helping you understand where and how gaps in uncertainty, risk, knowledge, and fairness emerge, and how to close them.\n\nYou do not want to win an argument. You want to win.\n\n- The minority often rules the majority\n\nFor example, 70% of the lamb meat the UK imports from New Zealand is processed according to halal standards. However, only 4% of the population is Muslim, which is the main group that demands halal meat. How can such a small segment account for such a large share of imports? Well, minority rule is usually a result of the majority being flexible or indifferent. In this case, non-Muslims don't mind eating halal meat over non-halal meat as there is no difference in taste.\n\nThe majority [doesn't care](https://fourminutebooks.com/the-life-changing-magic-of-not-giving-a-fck-summary/), so the minority gets what it wants. Similarly, firms selling genetically modified food have a hard time advertising. Most people are happy to eat non-genetically modified food because the products don't have a big advantage. Hence, the small but hardcore group of anti-GMO activists decides what makes it onto the shelves.\n\n- Asymmetry and missing incentives\n\nIf an actor pockets some rewards from a policy they enact or support without accepting any of the risks, economists consider it to be a problem of \"missing incentives\". In contrast, to Taleb, the problem is more fundamentally one of asymmetry: one actor gets the rewards, the other is stuck with the risks.\n\nTaleb argues that \"For social justice, focus on symmetry and risk sharing. You cannot make profits and transfer the risks to others, as bankers and large corporations do... Forcing [skin in the game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_in_the_game_(phrase)) corrects this asymmetry better than thousands of laws and regulations.\"\n\n## The centrality of negative incentives\n\nActors - per Taleb - must bear a cost when they fail the public. A fund manager that gets a percentage on wins, but no penalty for losing is incentivized to gamble with his clients funds. Bearing no downside for one's actions means that one has no \"Skin In The Game\", which is the source of many evils.\n\nAn evolutionary process is an additional argument for SITG. Those who err and have SITG will not survive, hence evolutionary processes will eliminate (physically or figuratively by going bankrupt etc) those tending to do stupid things. Without SITG, this process cannot work.\n\n## Examples\n\n[Robert Rubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rubin), a highly-paid director and senior advisor at [Citigroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup), paid no financial penalty when Citigroup had to be rescued by U.S. taxpayers due to overreach. Taleb calls this sort of a trade, with upside gain but no or limited downside risk, a \"Bob Rubin trade.\"\n\nMany [war hawks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_hawk) don't themselves bear any risks of dying in a war they advocate.\n\n- Successful people don't always have to be competent, because how we evaluate winners is industry-dependent\n\nFor example, a lawyer who is extremely sought after, but dresses very sloppily, is bound to have proven herself in court over and over again. If she didn't win cases, people wouldn't hire her. The same is true for surgeons, authors whose book's sell like crazy, and elite soldiers: without stellar results, they'd never have made it.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum are CEOs, [politicians](https://fourminutebooks.com/fear-summary/), and bankers. Being good at what you do won't hurt your chances here, but the **main requirement for doing well is beingperceivedas capable**. After all, votes and thus people's opinions decide who gets the part.\n\n- Rich people are easier to scam, because they have less to lose than the people selling to them\n\nThe more money you have, the more easily I can convince you to part with some of it.If it's a small portion of your overall fortune, you won't mind as much. The risk-reward-ratio becomes skewed in favor of the seller. They have more skin in the game.\n\nIf they sell you a mansion for $4,000,000 rather than $1,000,000, they'll get four times the commission. For someone worth $200 million, however, it almost doesn't matter whether they drop one million on a home or four.\n\n- **Intellectual Yet Idiot**\n\nIntellectual Yet Idiot (IYI) is a term coined by [Nassim Nicholas Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb) in his essay by the same name that refers to the semi-intelligent well-pedigreed \"who are telling us 1) what to do, 2) what to eat, 3) how to speak, 4) how to think... and 5) who to vote for\". They represent a very small minority of people but have an overwhelming impact on the vast majority because they affect government policy. IYI are often policy makers, academics, journalists, and media pundits.\n\nThe IYI pathologizes others for doing things he doesn't understand without ever realizing it is his understanding that may be limited. He thinks people should act according to their best interests and he knows their interests, particularly if they are \"[red necks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_neck)\" or English non-crisp-vowel class who voted for [Brexit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit). When plebeians do something that makes sense to them, but not to him, the IYI uses the term \"uneducated\". What we generally call participation in the political process, he calls by two distinct designations: \"democracy\" when it fits the IYI, and \"populism\" when the plebeians dare voting in a way that contradicts his preferences.\n\nTaleb points out that being educated and \"intellectual\" does not always mean that someone isn't an idiot for most purposes. \"You can be an intellectual yet still be an idiot. 'Educated [philistines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philistine)' have been wrong on everything from [Stalinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalinism) to [Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_conflict_(2003%E2%80%93present)) to [low-carb diets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbohydrate_diet).\"\n","excerpt":"Books / Blinkist Management Books
