Understand your intentions\n\n2. Understand yourself\n\n3. Align your intentions\n\n## Resistance vs Exhaution\n\n- There are various techniques to overcome resistance\n  - Divide the task into multiple subtasks\n  - All this must be as public as possible, because then it creates a sense of responsibility\n\n## Motivation\n\n1. A good pre-game routine starts by being so easy that you can't say no to it. You shouldn't need motivation to start your pre--game routine.\n\n2.

Habit is an energy saver for us. It allows us to free our mind for other types of activities.\n\n## Self Reliance\n\nSelf-reliance is nothing more than being self-sufficient. It means notclingingto people. It means not making life harder for others than it already is.\n\n## Self Affirmation\n\n- when people receive information about the risks of their current lifestyle, they tend to avoid, downplay, or derogate such information (this is called defensive processing)\n- you can overcome your own defensive processing with self-affirma- tion\n  - one way to self-affirm is by reflecting on your most cherished personal values and strengths (see an online test)\n  - another way is to repeat positive statements about possible change in important areas in your life (e.g. \"I'm capable of grad- ually improving my diet\") -- these need to be grounded in reality\n- self-affirmation helps you realize that you're a competent and adequate person, even though you may not always have perfect self-control.\n\nConstrue - interpret\n\n## Construal - a person's perception and interpretation of attributes and behavior of the self or of others\n\na construal is a way that people perceive, comprehend, and interpret their world, particularly the acts of others toward them.\n\n## Construal and Reappraisal: Reframing Self-Control Conflict\n\n- Whenever making an important decision, get yourself into a high-level (=abstract) construal by asking yourself a series of '**why**' questions\n  - for instance, if you want to lose weight, ask yourself: Why do I\n        want to lose weight?\n  - if your answer is 'to be more attractive', turn it into another 'why'\n        question: Why do I want to be attractive?\n  - Do this until you've connected to your deepest values (because it\n        gives me great joy, because I deeply value my life, etc.)\n- Whenever you need to plan how to achieve your goals, you need to\n    get into a low-level (=concrete) construal by asking yourself a series of '**how**' questions\n- If you have a tendency for harsh self-criticism, practice mindful construal\n\n- When deciding between a tempting option (watching TV, smoking a cigarette, eating a high-calorie dessert) and a healthy option (exercising, drinking herbal tea, eating fruit), you can use three re-appraisal strategies:\n  - You can stimulate disgust by imaging the possible negative consequences of choosing the tempting option (e.g. someone sneezing on food)\n  - You can think of the positive consequences of not choosing the tempting option (e.g. not putting on weight)\n  - The best approach is to focus on the positive aspects of selecting the healthy option (e.g. staying slim and healthy, feeling proud of yourself)\n\n## Construal-Level Theory (CLT)\n\nPeople are capable of thinking about the future, the past, remote locations, another person's perspective, and counterfactual alternatives. Without denying the uniqueness of each process, it is proposed that they constitute different forms of traversing psychological distance. Psychological distance is egocentric: Its reference point is the self in the here and now, and the different ways in which an object might be removed from that point - in time, in space, in social distance, and in hypotheticality - constitute different distance dimensions. Transcending the self in the here and now entails mental construal, and the farther removed an object is from direct experience, the higher (more abstract) the level of construal of that object.\n\nIf something feels far from us, we view it abstractly. This is calledhigh-levelconstrual.\n\nWhen something feels close, we view it more concretely. This is calledlow-levelconstrual.\n\n<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3152826>\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construal_level_theory>\n\n## Hyperopia\n\nwhen people persistently sacrifice their immediate desires for their long term goals. This is called 'hyperopia'\n\n![image](media/Self-Control-Will-Power-image6.png)\n\n1. I often fail to enjoy attractive opportunities.\n\n2. It's hard for me to make myself indulge.\n\n3. I regret missed opportunities to enjoy rich experiences in the past.\n\n4. I have difficulty pampering myself.\n\n5. \"Seizing the day\" is difficult for me.\n\n6. I rarely enjoy the luxuries life has to offer\n\n- hyperopia is not the same thing as extremely strong self-control -- rather, it's an excessive focus on the distant goal of being productive at all cost\n- the result of hyperopia is a lack of life satisfaction and often poor health\n- you can overcome hyperopia by:\n  - pre-committing to indulgence (e.g. buying vouchers)\n  - anticipating that you'll regret your puritan decisions in the future (with high-level construal)\n  - indulging after you've made a lot of effort at work\n  - making use of discounts and promotions\n  - making up 'functional alibi' (=emphasizing utilitarian value of objects rather than their hedonic qualities)\n\n## Two types of tired\n\nTwo different types of feeling tired when deciding whether to push forward with more effortful activities or give myself a break.\n\n## The first kind of tired is felt mostly as you're initiating an activity. This is the feeling you have as you think about going to the gym, but it sounds hard and frustrating and maybe you should just watch another episode ofThe Officefirst\n\nHowever, once you actually get to the gym, your mood changes. Suddenly it's not so bad and when you get home after you're glad you went.\n\n## The second kind of fatigue persists throughout the activity itself. You've decided to read a hard book for fun. Except it's not really so muchfunas it is a slow torture. Your mind darts every fifteen seconds and you struggle with pushing through more than five minutes of it\n\nThe first kind of fatigue doesn't seem to match up with the energy metaphor much at all. In this case, you think the activity will be exhausting, but when you actually get going, it doesn't feel so bad. The effort is all in the starting, not the doing.\n\nThis is the kind of feeling you want to push through. If you can overcome that initial hiccup to taking action, everything gets much easier.\n\nThe second kind of feeling might be something you encourage yourself to do for specific goals, but if your entire life feels that way for weeks at a time, your habits are probably unsustainable.\n\n## Make a distinction between a lack of inertia and persistent exhaustion from an activity being more hassle than help. If you push yourself to the gym, but feel good after you went, that's good. On the other hand, if you constantly feel exhausted by everything, you might be pushing yourself towards burn out\n\n<https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/01/13/too-tired>\n\n<https://dariusforoux.com/work-hard-without-burning-out>\n\n## How to use the power of movies to have same dedication for study\n\n<https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2021/05/03/effort-opportunity-cost>\n\n1.
