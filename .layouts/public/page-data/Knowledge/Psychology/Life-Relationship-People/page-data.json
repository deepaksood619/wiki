Then you empower them to achieve those goals using their own skills and talents in any way they choose. If, at the same time, you demonstrate how enormously you value them, not just through compensation, but also verbally, every single day, and if you enable that talent to share in the profit that they help create for you, you'll be successful. It's so simple, and virtually nobody does it, because it requires a high-trust working environment, and most business environments are low-trust.

Greatest gift - Helping your partner through hard times (simply standing by your partner during rough periods)\n\n## How to be an adult in relationships by David Richo\n\n- The emotional support we seek when we're young can be broken down into what the author callsthe five A's. They are attention, acceptance, appreciation, affection, and allowing others to be who they are.\n  - First up, attention. In relationships, being attentive to our partners means listening to their thoughts and emotions. Often, this involves being what the author calls a \"mindful witness.\" Our loved ones may have suffered abuse, betrayals, or hurts in the past and, as their partners, it's our job to listen to their stories respectfully.\n  - Second, there isacceptance-- of ourselves and others. Mutual acceptance is the bedrock of a healthy relationship. When we find someone who loves us -- with all our feelings and emotional burdens -- we feel liberated. We don't have to hide behind a mask because our partner loves us for all that we are.\n  - The third thing isappreciation.This involves valuing our partners' gifts, knowing and understanding their limitations, and supporting them in the pursuit of their dreams and desires.\n  - Affection is the fourthAon the list. It involves holding and touching our partners in respectful ways. Receiving affection in the form of kisses, hugs, or even a gentle smile across a room helps us feel loved and wanted. It meets our childlike need to feel safe and secure.\n  - The fifth and finalAisallowinglife and love to be just what they are -- with all their sorrow, ecstasy, and heartache -- without trying to take control. This is what it takes to bepresentin a relationship: to love and to be loved.\n- Working through our issues involves paying attention and letting go.\n- mindfulness -- an ancient Buddhist practice that brings our attention to what is happening in the present. Through mindfulness techniques, clients learn to notice the thoughts or feelings that arise within them -- but, instead of holding on to them, they learn to let them go.\n- To begin, sit in a quiet space with your eyes open or closed, your back straight, and your hands placed in your lap. Pay attention to your breath. When thoughts or anxieties enter your mind, notice them, label them as \"thoughts,\" and then return to your breathing. Of course, this takes practice. Eventually, your breath will drown out any distracting thoughts in the back of your mind.\n- **This is how we can think of relationships, too: they start out with romance, they progress into conflict, and then repose in commitment. And these cycles can repeat themselves again and again.**\n  - Romance > Conflict > Compromise\n  - In a committed relationship, couples are able to give and receive thefive A's. They let go of their desire to be right in arguments, and instead search for compromise. They may still fight, but they do not stop loving each other.\n  - \"The rose of relationship grows petals in romance, thorns in conflict, and roots in commitment.\"\n- Admit, Allow, andAct As If.\n  - First, you have to admit your fears to yourself and others. This involves naming your fears without blaming anyone. For example, you could say to your partner,\"I am scared to get close to you because . . . ,\" or\"my fear of betrayal comes from . . . .\"\n  - Then, you have to allowyourself to feel your fears, without judging them. This aligns with our practice of mindfulness: we allow our feelings to emerge, we recognize them for what they are, and then we let them go.\n  - Next up, act as if you have no fear. For example, if you fear abandonment, try to get comfortable being away from your partner for one minute more each day. And, if you fear engulfment, try to stay away from your partner for one minute less.\n- Loving one person teaches us how to love the rest of the world.\n\n## Friendship\n\n![image](media/Life-Relationship-People-image2.jpeg)\n\n## Tips\n\n- Always make the first move\n- In marriages, there are divergent expectations.

An MC can be an important part of a birthday party, acting as a host to allow the birthday boy or girl to enjoy the party along with guests. Although the party atmosphere will provide a good time, the MC ideally remains focused on the multifaceted responsibilities the job demands.\n\n- Annoucements\n- Music selection\n- Setting the tone\n- Setting the place\n\n<https://pdfslide.net/documents/emcee-academic-debate-script.html>\n\n<https://www.ehow.com/info_8146690_mcs-duties-birthday-party.html>\n\n<https://www.ehow.com/info_8201232_duties-emcee.html>\n\n1. **Arrive to the party venue well before the guests** so you can become familiar with the sound system and test the microphone. Showing up early will also allow you to see how the party site is set up, so you know where to make eye contact to keep the audience engaged.\n\n2. **Look at the program for your manager's farewell party**. As the MC, you'll need to know how to introduce each speaker that will present an award or kind word to the **guest of honor.** If you have a small speech prepared, becoming familiar with the program will give you an idea of when you should present it. If necessary, jot down a few notes on the program that will help you with guest introductions, such as \"worked with guest of honor the longest\" or \"closest professional friend.\"\n\n3. Take your place on the stage or podium before guests arrive so you can welcome all the party goers.\n\n4. **State the reason for the gathering,** and lead the guests in showing your manager a round of applause as she's ushered into the room or seated at the main table.\n\n5. **Introduce each individual** before he gets up to share a short speech or poem at the celebration, using your notes as guidelines. Encourage the crowd to give every presenter a round of applause as he walks to the front of the room.\n\n6. **Conclude the speaking portion** of the farewell party by sharing a fond memory you have of your manager, and calling her up to the front so you can present her with a gift from you and the rest of your colleagues, like a plaque or large bouquet of flowers.\n\n7. **Thank everyone for coming** to the farewell celebration and prompt everyone to continue socializing or dining or cordially dismiss them from the party venue, depending on how the program is scheduled.\n\n## Techniques for preparing for stressed events beforehand\n\n- Prospective Hindsight\n- Pre-mortem\n\n## Pregnancy / Birth Plan\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_ssj7-8rYg>\n\n<https://www.parents.com/pregnancy/giving-birth/labor-and-delivery/checklist-how-to-write-a-birth-plan>\n\n## Parenting / children\n\n- **Homeschooling / Home School / Homeschool**\n  - Khan academy\n  - <https://primer.com>\n- **Thoughts**\n  - **I want to raise my children in UK or US (good child care programs, that develops childs brain)**\n  - Or parents live with me\n  - 1st 3 years of the child's brain development is most important\n  - Never ever fight before the children\n  - How to develop curiosity in a child (thirst and passion of knowledge)\n    - Hard working\n    - Balanced life\n- Have child early, so that phase is complete and then you can focus on ageing parents (so they both don't coincide)\n- Children do not cry if they fall down if no one is around, they will standup and find their parents, and seeing their parents, they will start crying\n- Have 3 serial marriages over the lifetime (Youthful passion, Parenthood, Companionship, and all 3 can be the same too) - there are 3 different demands\n- **Pre-Marital Genetic Counselling (for rare diseases defect)**\n- Minimilism Tricks on Kids - Tell kids that they can have all the toys they want until they can be stored in a cupboard.

It is taught by certified teachers through a standard course of instruction, which costs a fee that varies by country. According to the Transcendental Meditation movement, it is a non-religious method for relaxation, [stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)) reduction, and self-development. The technique has been seen as both religiousand non-religious;[sociologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociologist), scholars, and a [New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey) judge and court are among those who have expressed views on it being religious or non-religious.The United States Court of Appeals upheld the federal ruling that TM was essentially \"religious in nature\" and therefore could not be taught in public schools.\n\nHigh-quality studies that demonstrate positive health outcomes that can be attributed to the specific practice of TM as compared to other forms of stress reduction do not exist.\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_Meditation>\n\n## Healthy social interactions\n\n1.

It is commonly applied to assess [implicit stereotypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_stereotype) held by test subjects, such as unconsciously associating stereotypically black names with words consistent with black stereotypes. The test's format is highly versatile, and has been used to investigate biases in racial groups, gender, sexuality, age, and religion, as well as assessing self-esteem.\n\nThe IAT was introduced in the scientific literature in 1998 by [Anthony Greenwald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Greenwald), Debbie McGhee, and Jordan Schwartz.The IAT is now widely used in social psychology research and, to some extent, in [clinical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology), [cognitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_psychology), and [developmental psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology) research. The IAT is the subject of much controversy regarding validity, reliability, and whether test results are an accurate representation of [implicit bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_bias).\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit-association_test>\n\n## Ethnography - Study of people and culture\n\nin-depth observation of how people behave and interact with their surroundings\n\n## Worst idea of psychology - Mind is a blank slated birth\n\nDevelopmental psychology has shown that kids come into the world, already knowing so much about the physical and social world and programmed in such a way as to make it easy to learn certain things and hard to learn others\n\n## Inateness\n\n![image](media/Life-Relationship-People-image4.png)\n\n1. **Harm/care**\n\n2. **Fairness/reciprocity**\n\n3. **Ingroup/loyalty**\n\n4. **Authority/respect**\n\n5. **Purity/sanctity**\n\n6. ![image](media/Life-Relationship-People-image5.png)\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SOQduoLgRw>\n\n## Blinkist - Didn't see it coming by Carey Nieuwhof\n\nOvercoming the 7 greatest challenges that no one expects and everyone experiences\n\n1.

But they also present opportunities to reevaluate our lives and what makes them meaningful.\n- We can't always control disruptive events, but we do control our response to them.\n  - ABC stands for autonomy, belonging, and cause\n- Rituals help us to say goodbye to the lives we're leaving behind.\n  - We can turn destructive events into meaningful transitions, but this requires practice. Luckily, several key tools can help us become masters at dealing with transitions.\n  - The first tool we need to master is acceptance\n  - A very normal reaction to experiencing a lifequake is denial and resistance.\n  - Acceptance can strike in a sudden epiphany, or a series of slow realizations.\n- All major transitions involve a messy middle, where we feel very lost.\n- Our creativity can help us to create a new chapter in a transition.\n  - Every major religious narrative and fairy tale recognizes the value of being lost. Jesus was cast into the desert before he had a major epiphany, and Mohamed gained his wisdom on a mountaintop. The most formative experience of Red Riding Hood's life would never have been possible if she hadn't wandered into that forest.\n- We need to create new life stories that integrate our transitions.\n- Actionable advice: Pay attention to small wins.\n\n## Blinkist - Power Relationships by Andrew Sobel and Jerold Panas (23 May 2019)\n\n26 irrefutable laws for building extraordinary relationships\n\n- Power relationships come from great conversations and being unafraid to ask\n- Build a small network of people you like and trust before you need it, including people dissimilar to you\n  - 12 - 15 apostles\n- Strengthen your relationships by believing in people, and helping them accomplish their agendas\n- Serious relationships demand a strong foundation, integrity and empathy\n  - Each time you refuse to compromise your integrity, it gets stronger and more resilient\n- Giving trust and changing environments can deepen relationships\n- Focus on the right questions rather than having all the answers, and remember that awkward beginnings can be overcome\n- Earn new clients by treating them like current clients, and keep clients by contributing to their profit and growth\n- Keep people curious in order to remain attractive, but remember to be vulnerable and enthusiastic\n- Remember to give truth, love and praise to show people that you value them, and to help them grow\n  - Every act of generosity creates a ripple\n- **Actionable advice - Create a list of those you want in your network**\n\n## Ikigai\n\n![Image for post](media/Life-Relationship-People-image7.jpg)\n\n## ikigaiis seen as the convergence of four primary elements\n\n- What you love (your passion)\n- What the world needs (your mission)\n- What you are good at (your vocation)\n- What you can get paid for (your profession)\n\n## 10 Rules\n\n1.

Standardized tests only measure one kind of human intelligence and schools only cater to a few learning styles.\n- Every person is special and different because of their genetic makeup (every human who ever existed in history has their own genes) and their environment (everyone has their unique mix of family, friends, and location).\n- If you accept you can't predict or control the future, you will discover many new opportunities.\n- Experiencing positive emotions from your passion reduces stress, chronic pain, and addictions.

So, in order to live well, we must maintain our relationships.\n  - Daoismshares Confucianism's sense of interconnectedness, but it places emphasis onnature. It embraces things on their own terms and never lets emotions cloud thoughts. Some people think that Daoism is just about being with nature, but there's more to it than that. Our relationship with nature can represent the challenges we face in life.\n  - A contemporary example of a Daoist mindset is what Professor Robin R. Wang calls the \"Realtor's mentality.\" A realtor might work for 30 clients at once knowing that only a couple will buy from him. Rather than getting frustrated by the low success rate, the realtor learns not to fixate on any one client and calmly accepts the reality of that situation.\n- Aristotelianism encourages us to flourish -- but acknowledges that external factors also play their part.\n  - AnAristotelianis someone who follows Aristotle's teachings from his famous work, Nicomachean Ethics.\n  - Think of a very talented tennis player -- someone who is good enough to count as one of the all-time greats. If she lives during a period when the competition is weak, she will never be able to prove her talent. That player simply won't have an opportunity to flourish.\n  - Unfortunately, we're not all equally capable of this -- just like that talented tennis player. Think of someone born into an unsupportive family, or someone whose life is ruined by a natural disaster. It's harder for these people to flourishthrough no fault of their own.\n- Stoicism focuses on indifference, while Epicureanism focuses on pleasure.\n  - ataraxia-- a state of tranquility -- so she will be able to cope calmly with misfortune.\n  - Stoics divide things outside their control into two categories:preferredanddispreferred indifferents. Think about wealth. Being rich is always going to be preferred, while being poor is dispreferred. But Stoicism says that your level of wealth doesn't affect how virtuous you are. A rich person may be either good or bad. So, wealth is \"indifferent\" and doesn't affect whether you're a good person.\n  - A Stoic's focus on indifference can also help with negative emotions. Say someone insults you. Rather than getting angry, think about the criticism. Is there any truth in it? If so, the insulter has done you a favor. If not, who cares? The person is wrong. Not that we should be emotionless. Stoicism does allow for positive emotions like joy and love.\n  - Epicureanismplaces more emphasis on feeling. In fact, it's based around the simple concept ofpleasure.\n    - We all naturally strive for pleasure. Even babies avoid pain and seek pleasure -- it's what philosopher and author Hiram Crespo calls thepleasure-aversion faculty. That doesn't mean unbridled hedonism, though -- not if we practicehedonic calculus. Hedonic calculus involves weighing whether something is likely to prove pleasurable in the longer term.\n    - So an epicure wouldn't simply drink all the beer in one evening. He would recognize that, after a certain number of beers, the overall experience -- hangover included -- wouldn't be pleasurable. Conversely, some major decisions like studying at a university might be painful at first, but pleasurable in the long run.\n- Hinduism and Progressive Islam both bring ancient ideas into a modern context.\n  - Progressive Islam rejects extremism, champions social and gender justice, and embraces the multiple faiths that make up the modern world.\n- \"Ethical values like justice and fairness do not remain frozen in time.\" -- Adis Duderija\n- In both Judaism and Christianity, scripture provides an opportunity for reflection.\n- Ethical Culture and secular humanism are two philosophies that don't involve belief in God.\n  - Ethical Culture, which defines itself as a nontheistic religion. As its name suggests, it places a strong emphasis on ethics and the value of community. It emphasizes the importance of these traditional values by having a clergy, like many theistic religions.\n  - Secular humanism, on the other hand, is not a religion. It's a non-dogmatic philosophy that stresses the importance of independent thinking.\n  - Guided by reason, secular humanism offers a practical way to understand and improve the human condition. The emphasis on reason means that secular humanism respects science deeply.\n- Existentialism and pragmatism both reflect on the ways in which we are free.\n  - Did you choose to be born? No? Neither did anyone else.\n  - That's the starting point for existentialism, the twentieth-century philosophy of Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. Having been born, we are conscious and free to make our own choices. Hence, in Sartre's words, we are \"condemned to be free.\"\n  - There's something contradictory about existentialism, as Skye C. Cleary acknowledges. Actually callingyourself an existentialist contradicts what it's really about. We shouldn't let ourselves be defined by any particular set of beliefs; instead, we should simply be authentic to ourselves. And as individuals, we're too complex to be summed up by a simple label anyway -- especially since we're all constantly changing.\n  - Sartre gave the example of a waiter who's good at his job. He comes to believe that being a waiter is what defines him. But no single role caneverdefine a person. We must acknowledge that things will change in the future, just like they did in the past.\n- Effective altruism is just one way we're still exploring philosophical questions today.\n  - Effective altruismtakes a simple approach. It asks its followers to examine how they canmaximizetheir positive impact on the world. In many cases, this is through donating as much as possible to charity. Or it might be through taking on jobs that do exceptional amounts of good.\n\n## Blinkist - The Almanack of Naval Ravikant\n\n- **A philosopher is someone who falls down a well while gazing up at the stars**\n- If you're unsure about a decision, then the answer is no\n- A good reputation is an invaluable asset\n- If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you\n  - Money can't buy happiness or make all your problems disappear, but it will solve your money problems.\n  - Zero-sum game have its uses. Take Politics. If we didn't play it, we wouldn't be able to tell who was in charge of things. Fundamentally, though, it's no more than a necessary evil. That's why you should seek to avoid it in your life. Play it too often and you'll become an angry, combative, and resentful person dedicated to putting others down\n  - The money game is different. It's not zero-sum, it's **positive-sum**. You can win without someone else losing, or become wealthy without condemning someone else to poverty.\n- Money can give you freedom - unless you love it for its own sake\n  - Money fixes a lot of external problems. It removes obstacles that stop you from doing the things you really want to do.\n  - It you love money, there's never enough - it's a **bottomless pit**\n- Happiness is a choice to remain in the present moment\n  - Happiness is understood as the absence of judgements, which is associated with the absence of desire. The **fewer desires** you have, the greater your ability to accept the way things are right now. This brings inner calm.\n  - The more you **live in the present**, the happier you'll be\n  - Think of young children. On balance, they're pretty happy. Why? Easy! They're immersed in the moment rather than caught up in their own heads.\n- A quiet mind is a happy mind\n  - To sit **still** for 30 minutes is happiness. The reason this is so hard to achieve is that we're distracted by our desires\n  - Happiness we think, is \"**out there**\" in the external world\n  - **Monkey Mind -** Thoughts, the Buddha said, are like branches, and the conscious mind is like a monkey swinging from one branch to the next\n  - The answer to this problem is to train the monkey. Meditation - quieting the simian chatter that prevents us from being present\n  - Meditation comes in different forms. Hiking is Walking meditation, Journaling is Writing meditation, prayer is gratitude meditation. Even showering can be a kind of accidental meditation\n- Discovering what calms your mind and building good habits are keys to happiness\n  - Happiness isn't innate - it's a skill\n  - Try different things and find out what works for you\n  - If it works, use it; if it doesn't, look for something else\n  - Cutting down on alcohol, caffeine and sugar will keep your mood more stable. So will avoiding social media\n  - Regular exercise is a good habit for both your body and your mind\n- Actionable advice - Lean into short-term pain (ex - working out)\n\n![image](media/Life-Relationship-People-image8.jpg)\n\n## From Strength to Strength: Finding Success, Happiness and Deep Purpose in the Second Half of Life\n\nOf the 125 people in Marcellus, half a dozen or so people are over 40. After we read Arthur Brooks' book 'From Strength to Strength' (thanks to a gift from a client who has also become a friend), we understood why those of us over 40 contribute the majority of the pieces to Three Longs and Three Shorts. As Brooks explains in this tightly written book, for people like us in the Finance profession, the raw intellectual horsepower or our brain (which is called 'fluid intelligence') starts waning from the age of 40. Thankfully, however, a different type of intelligence starts improving from that age, namely, 'crystallised intelligence' i.e. the ability to absorb lots of different bits of information and influences and join the dots. Brooks uses this framework to give professionals in their 40s and 50s a framework for the second half of their careers.\n\nAs Jonathan Knee says in his review of this book:\"According to From Strength to Strength...the basic problem is the inevitable decline in our abilities. The decline in peak performance begins far earlier than we are likely to admit across professions, not just in athletes. According to Brooks, \"on average, the peak of creative careers occurs at about 20 years after career inception,\" so that professional decay is likely to commence between ages 35 and 50. Financial professionals peak between 36 and 40.\n\nLike drug addiction, each subsequent hit of success yields a shorter period of satisfaction, necessitating greater feats of performance just as the capacity to produce them declines with age.\n\nStrength to Strength reads like a companion volume to the cult classic from 1979, The Drama of the Gifted Child by Swiss psychoanalyst Alice Miller. Miller pointed out that talented children can become addicted to the positive feedback that their talents inspire, and may never develop an identity independent of the expectations of others.\"\n\nSo what is the solution to the mid-40s fade? How can those of us who are in the second half of our careers capitalise on our crystalised intelligence? Brooks' answer is that we should turn to teaching, writing and mentoring rather than trying to compete with younger people who are at their peak in terms of fluid intelligence.\n\nHowever, this is not as easy as it sounds. Whilst several of us 40 plusers in Marcellus are writing, teaching and mentoring, we will be the first to admit that old habits are hard to shake off. Says Jim Clemmer:\"Arthur devotes a chapter to \"Kick Your Success Addiction\" with powerful examples, research, and advice on dealing with workaholism and getting off the hedonic treadmill. \"The buzz from success is neutralized quickly, leaving a hangover feeling.... after a while, you need constant success hits just not to feel like a failure...the carrot is gradually getting further away, despite the fact that you are running faster than ever. Thus, the dissatisfaction problem compounds the decline problem.\"\n\nArthur provides several steps to transitioning from fluid intelligence to the second curve of crystallized intelligence. This includes pondering our death - what do we want our life to stand for, cultivating (real versus \"deal\") relationships, deepening our spirituality, making the weakness of our decline a strength to connecting with others, and filling the second half of our lives with opportunities rather than loss. He concludes with a chapter on Seven Words to Remember; \"Use things. Love people. Worship the divine.\"\"\n\nInterestingly, Buddhist and Hindu philosophy plays a key role in the prescriptions that Arthur Brooks dispenses in this timely book (timely for those of us who are battling with the decline of our fluid intelligence and the rise of our crystallised intelligence).\n\n## Thoughts about people\n\nAlmost everyone in this world is idiot and have nothing to contribute, but never say this to them... Always say them okay and ignore instead of demeaning him/her, because they cannot handle it\n\nDon't say bad to people whom you don't give money, only if they are dependent on you, and they are fearful you can say something\n\nOtherwise show disappointment\n\n## Financial Experts\n\n1.
