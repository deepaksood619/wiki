Comparative advantageis the economic reality describing the work [gains from trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gains_from_trade) for individuals, firms, or nations, which arise from differences in their [factor endowments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_endowments) or [technological progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_progress).In an [economic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_model), [agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_(economics)) have a comparative advantage over others in producing a particular [good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_(economics)) if they can produce that good at a lower relative [opportunity cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost) or [autarky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autarky) price, i.e. at a lower relative [marginal cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_cost) prior to trade.One does not compare the monetary costs of production or even the resource costs (labor needed per unit of output) of production. Instead, one must compare the [opportunity costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost) of producing goods across countries.\n\n[David Ricardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo) developed the classical theory of comparative advantage in 1817 to explain why countries engage in [international trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade) even when one country's workers are more efficient at producingeverysingle good than workers in other countries. He demonstrated that if two countries capable of producing two commodities engage in the [free market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market), then each country will increase its overall consumption by exporting the good for which it has a comparative advantage while importing the other good, provided that there exist differences in [labor productivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_productivity) between both countries.Widely regarded as one of the most powerfulyet counter-intuitiveinsights in economics, Ricardo's theory implies that comparative advantage rather than [absolute advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_advantage) is responsible for much of international trade.\n\n(3)[Comparative Advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage#More_recent_evidence)--- \"An agent has a comparative advantage over another in producing a particular good if they can produce that good at a lower relative opportunity cost or autarky price, i.e. at a lower relative marginal cost prior to trade.\"\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage>\n\n<https://dariusforoux.com/opportunity-cost>\n\n## Diversification\n\nIn finance, diversificationis the process of allocating capital in a way that reduces the exposure to any one particular asset or risk. A common path towards diversification is to reduce [risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_risk) or volatility by [investing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment) in a variety of [assets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset). If asset prices do not change in perfect synchrony, a diversified [portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_(finance)) will have less variance than the [weighted average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean) variance of its constituent assets, and often less volatility than the least volatile of its constituents.\n\nDiversification is one of two general techniques for reducing investment risk. The other is [hedging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance))\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversification_(finance)>\n\n## Hedge\n\nAhedgeis an investment position intended to offset potential losses or gains that may be incurred by a companion investment. In simple language, a hedge is a [risk management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management) technique used to reduce any substantial losses or gains suffered by an individual or an organization.\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)>\n\n## Economies of scale\n\nIn [microeconomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microeconomics), economies of scaleare the cost advantages that enterprises obtain due to their scale of operation (typically measured by amount of output produced), with cost per unit of output decreasing with increasing scale. (In economics, \"scale\" is synonymous with quantity.)\n\nEconomies of scale apply to a variety of organizational and business situations and at various levels, such as a business or manufacturing unit, plant or an entire enterprise. When average costs start falling as output increases, then economies of scale are occurring. If a firm's [marginal cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_cost) of producing a good or service is beneath its [average cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_cost) of producing that good or service, then the firm is experiencing economies of scale. Some economies of scale, such as capital cost of manufacturing facilities and friction loss of transportation and industrial equipment, have a [physical or engineering basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale#Physical_and_engineering_basis).\n\nAnother source of scale economies is the possibility of purchasing inputs at a lower per-unit cost when they are purchased in large quantities.\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale>\n\n## Efficient-market hypothesis\n\nThe efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) is a theory in [financial economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_economics) that states that [asset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset) prices fully reflect all available information. A direct implication is that it is impossible to \"beat the market\" consistently on a risk-adjusted basis since market prices should only react to new information.\n\nThe efficient-market hypothesis was developed by [Eugene Fama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Fama) who argued that stocks always trade at their fair value, making it impossible for investors to either purchase undervalued stocks or sell stocks for inflated prices.As such, it should be impossible to outperform the overall market through expert stock selection or market timing, and that the only way an investor can possibly obtain higher returns is by chance or by purchasing riskier investments.His 2012 study with [Kenneth French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_French) supported this view, showing that the distribution of abnormal returns of US mutual funds is very similar to what would be expected if no fund managers had any skill - a necessary condition for the EMH to hold.\n\nThere are three variants of the hypothesis: \"weak\", \"semi-strong\", and \"strong\" form. The weak form of the EMH claims that prices on traded [assets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset)(e.g., [stocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock), [bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)), or property) already reflect all past publicly available [information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information). The semi-strong form of the EMH claims both that prices reflect all publicly available information and that prices instantly change to reflect new public information. The strong form of the EMH additionally claims that prices instantly reflect even hidden \"insider\" information.\n\nThere is no quantitative measure of market efficiency and testing the idea is difficult. So-called \"effect studies\" provide some of the best evidence, but they are open to other interpretations. Critics have blamed the belief in [rational markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_expectations) for much of the [late-2000s financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late-2000s_financial_crisis).In response, proponents of the hypothesis have stated that market efficiency does not mean not having any uncertainty about the future; that market efficiency is a simplification of the world which may not always hold true; and that the market is practically efficient for investment purposes for most individuals.\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis>\n\n## Game Theory\n\nGame theory is the study of [mathematical models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model) of strategic interaction between rational decision-makers.It has applications in all fields of [social science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science), as well as in [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic) and [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science). Originally, it addressed [zero-sum games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game), in which one person's gains result in losses for the other participants. Today, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations, and is now an [umbrella term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbrella_term) for the [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science) of logical decision making in humans, animals, and computers.\n\n- Patience - If you go to a car dealer and ask that you need a car urgent then he is not going to give you any offers, but if you say that I need a car but you will wait for the best offer and it's not urgent, then he will give you a good offer.\n\n- Take it or leave it deal\n\n- Competitive Game Theory\n- Cooperative Game Theory (for friends)\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory>\n\n## Scarcity\n\nThe tension between infinite wants and finite resources\n\nScarcityis the limited availability of a [commodity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity), which may be in demand in the market. Scarcity also includes an individual's lack of resources to buy commodities\n\n## Supply and Demand\n\nIn [microeconomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microeconomics), supply and demandis an [economic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_model) of [price determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_determination) in a [market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_(economics)). It postulates that, [holding all else equal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceteris_paribus), in a [competitive market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_competition), the [unit price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_price) for a particular [good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_(economics)), or other traded item such as labor or liquid financial assets, will vary until it settles at a point where the quantity demanded (at the current price) will equal the quantity supplied (at the current price), resulting in an [economic equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_equilibrium) for price and quantity transacted. However, this model does not hold in cases with [positive feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback) which can lead to an [economic bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_bubble) as in the housing market in the early 21st century that led to the [subprime mortgage crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis).\n\n## Greater Fool Theory\n\nIn [finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance) and [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics), thegreater fool theory states that the [price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price) of an object is determined not by its [intrinsic value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_value_(finance)), but rather by the local and relative demand of a specific consumer. In an inflated market, a consumer, despite having broader market knowledge might pay an inflated price because of their needs and the local related-market value. Another consumer relative to their needs and assessment of market value may deem the price excessive. Thus to one consumer the commodity has a greater value than to another making the former look like a fool to the latter.\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory>\n\n## The Reward to Risk Ratio (RRR)\n\nA good trade should be characterised by a rich RRR. In other words, for every Rs.1/- you risk on a trade your expected return should be at least Rs.1.3/- or higher, otherwise it is simply not a worth the risk.\n\n## Value added manufacturing\n\nInput of raw materials vs output of finished goods.\n\nIndustries/factories produce value and add value to economy\n\nNobel Laureate Thomas Schelling, a game theorist, coined the term **\"value of a statistical life\"** (VSL) in 1968\n\n## Paradox of Thrift\n\nThe paradox of thrift, or paradox of savings, is an economic theorywhich posits that personal savings are a net drag on the economy during a recession. This theory relies on the assumption that prices do not clear or that producers fail to adjust to changing conditions, contrary to the expectations of classical microeconomics. The paradox of thrift was popularized by British economist John Maynard Keynes.\n\n<https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paradox-of-thrift.asp>\n\n## Rule of three (Bruce Henderson of the Boston Consulting Group)\n\nA stable competitive market never has more than three significant competitors, the largest of which has no more than four times the market share of the smallest.\n\nI prefer a slightly different variant. Jagdish Sheth and Rajendra Sisodia, in 2002, described it like this:\n\n1. A competitive market usually gravitates towards three major players. These three players are 'generalists', and control a significant share of the market - usually upwards of 70%.\n\n2. The rest of the market is composed of niche specialists with tiny market shares but strong financial positions.\n\n3. Any attempts by these specialists to become a generalist by increasing market share is risky, and can result in death.\n\n## Industry consolidation life cycle\n\n![image](media/Mental-Models-image1.gif)\n\n## Cantillon effect\n\nCantillon effect explains how changes in the supply of money in an economy can affect the prices of different goods in different proportions. This is because the real purchasing power of individuals is not affected uniformly by the changes in money supply. The theory was proposed by Richard Cantillon, an Irish-French economist, as a counter to John Locke's crude quantity theory of money - which saw prices of all goods being affected proportionately by changes in money supply. Cantillon proposed the idea to argue that the differential effect of changes in the money supply on prices leads to booms and busts in the economy.\n\n## Investing\n\n- (2)[Fear of Missing Out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out)(FOMO) --- \"A pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent.\"\n- (2)[Preferred Stock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_stock) vs [Common Stock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_stock)--- \"Preferred stock is a type of stock which may have any combination of features not possessed by common stock including properties of both an equity and a debt instrument, and is generally considered a hybrid instrument.\"\n- (3)[Margin of Safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_safety_(financial))--- \"The difference between the intrinsic value of a stock and its market price.\"\n- (3)[Investing vs Speculation](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/difference-between-investing-speculating.asp)--- \"Typically, high-risk trades that are almost akin to gambling fall under the umbrella of speculation, whereas lower-risk investments based on fundamentals and analysis fall into the category of investing.\"\n- (3)[Compound Interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest)--- \"Interest on interest.

Marginal refers to the focus on the cost or benefit of the next unit or individual, for example, the cost to produce one more widget or the profit earned by adding one more worker.\n- Companies use marginal analysis as a decision-making tool to help them maximize their potential profits.\n- When a manufacturer wishes to expand its operations, either by adding new product lines or increasing the volume of goods produced from the current product line, a marginal analysis of the costs and benefits is necessary.\n\n## Utils - A unit used to quantify satisfaction; they are completely subjective\n\n## Utility\n\n- Satisfaction, or happiness people get from consuming a good or service\n\n## Law of diminishing marginal utility (difference between 200 and 201 parks is very less)\n\n## Law of decreasing additional satisfaction\n\n## Diamond water paradox\n\n## Marginal Utility\n\nthe benefit gained from consuming one additional unit of a product or service.\n\n\"the law of marginal utility states that the first x is worth more than the second x (be it dollars, hours of free time, video games, pieces of food, etc.)\"\n\nMarginal utility quantifies the added satisfaction that a [consumer](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/10/know-your-consumer-protection-laws.asp) garners from consuming additional units of goods or services. The concept of marginal utility is used by economists to determine how much of an item consumers are willing to purchase. Positive marginal utility occurs when the consumption of an additional item increases the total utility, while negative marginal utility occurs when the consumption of an additional item decreases the total utility.\n\nEx - For instance, you like eating pizza, the second piece of pizza brings you more satisfaction than only eating one piece of pizza. It means your marginal utility from purchasing pizza is positive. However, after eating the second piece you feel full, and you would not feel any better from eating the third piece. This means your marginal utility from eating pizza is zero. Moreover, you might feel sick if you eat more than three pieces of pizza. At this time, your marginal utility is negative.In other words, a negative marginal utility indicates that every unit of goods or service consumed will do more harm than good, which will lead to the decrease of overall utility level, while the positive marginal utility indicates that every unit of goods or services consumed will increase the overall utility level\n\n- **Zero marginal utility**is when having more of an item brings no extra measure of satisfaction. For example, if you receive two copies of the same issue of a magazine, that extra copy has little added value.\n- **Positive marginal utility**is when buying extra versions of an item is satisfying. One such example would be a store promotion where customers can walk out with a free pair of shoes if they buy two pairs up front.\n- **Negative marginal utility**is where too much of an item is actually detrimental. For example, while the correct dose of antibiotics can kill harmful bacteria, too much can harm a person's body.\n\n![image](media/Mental-Models-image2.jpeg)\n\n## Diminishing Marginal Utility (DMU)\n\n<https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginalutility.asp>\n\n### Substitution Effect - As prices rise consumers will replace more expensive items with less costly alternatives\n\n### Perfectly Inelastic Demand - Van Gogh Painting (There are only a fixed number of items)\n\n### Relatively Inelastic Demand - Oil (there are not a lot of alternatives)\n\n### Elastic Demand - Pizza (since there are a lot of substitutes)\n\nConsumer choice\n\n## Tragedy of the commons / Externalities\n\n### Rebound effect - The rebound effect says that the benefits of energy efficiency might be reduced as people change their behavior\n\n## Blinkist - Economics for the Common Good by Jean Tirole (15 Jun 2018)\n\n- Our understanding of how the economy works is shaped by confirmation biases\n  - ivory trade\n  - baby trade (neglects the interests of a third party)\n  - Externality - the cost of an exchange borne by a third party who can't consent to the exchange\n- Economists try to make the world a better place by providing insights for policymakers\n  - Game theory - Prisoner's dilemma\n\nA thought experiment that looks at how two prisoners will behave without knowing what the other is doing - will they betray each other in search of a more linient sentence or keep quite?\n\nAsks two questions -\n\n- What's the best decision for the individual?\n- What's the best decision for multiple parties collectively?\n\n- Information theory - centers on the way individuals make use of private information\n\nTenant farmer and a landlord - Private information about the fertility of land he may want to propose for a profit-sharing model rather than renting the land for a fixed sum.\n\n- Economics has a lot to learn from the social sciences and humanities\n  - homo economicus - self-interested and rationally calculating decision maker.\n  - homo psychologicus - interested in exploring the hidden drives\n  - Psychology - empathetic\n  - homo socialis - making informed decisions\n  - homo juridicus - obeys the rules and payes their taxes\n- Neither the state nor the market is perfect and they both need each other to function properly\n\nWithout markets there'd be little competition or innovation.

After all it's your wealth, And your life.\n\n## Quantitative Easing\n\nThe introduction of new money into the money supply by a central bank.\n\nQuantitative easing is an unconventional [monetary policy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp) in which a central bank purchases [government securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/governmentsecurity.asp) or other securities from the market in order to lower interest rates and increase the money supply. Quantitative easing increases the [money supply](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/moneysupply.asp) by flooding financial institutions with capital in an effort to promote increased lending and [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp). When short-term interest rates are at or approaching zero, and when the printing of new [banknotes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/banknote.asp) isn't an option, quantitative easing can be considered.\n\n## Money Supply / Money Stock\n\nThe money supply is the entire stock of [currency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency.asp) and other liquid instruments circulating in a country's economy as of a particular time. The money supply can include cash, coins and balances held in checking and savings accounts. Economists analyze the money supply and develop policies revolving around it through controlling [interest rates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) and increasing or decreasing the amount of money flowing in the economy.\n\n## Cost Push Inflation\n\nCost-push inflation occurswhen overall prices increase (inflation)due to increases in the cost of wages and raw materials. Cost-push inflation can occur when higher costs of production decrease the aggregate supply (the amount of total production) in the economy.\n\n## Recession shapes (Recovery types)\n\n![image](media/Mental-Models-image3.jpeg)\n\n- V-shaped recession\n\n![image](media/Mental-Models-image4.png)\n\n- U-shaped recession\n\n![image](media/Mental-Models-image5.png)\n\n- W-shaped recession (double-dip recession)\n\n![image](media/Mental-Models-image6.png)\n\n- L-shaped recession\n\n![image](media/Mental-Models-image7.png)\n\n- **K Shaped recovery**\n\nWhat 'K' means is those at the top are seeing things go up, and those at the middle and below are seeing things go down and get worse\n\nA K-shaped recovery occurs when an economy recuperates unevenly, and there's a separate trajectory for two segments of the society. While the financial markets recover and grow, the real economy, or the flow of goods and services, gets worse. That's worrying, because [84% of the stock market](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/business/economy/stocks-economy.html) is owned by 10% of households. While the market continued to rise even amid a global pandemic, GDP and employment rates fell.\n\n- **J Curve**\n\nThe [J Curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/j-curve-effect.asp) is an economic theory which states that, under certain assumptions, a country's [trade deficit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade_deficit.asp) will initially worsen after the [depreciation of its currency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency-depreciation.asp)-mainly because higher prices on imports will be greater than the reduced volume of imports.\n\nThe J Curve operates under the theory that the trading volumes of imports and exports first only experience [microeconomic](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/microeconomics.asp) changes. But as time progresses, export levels begin to dramatically increase, due to their more attractive prices to foreign buyers. Simultaneously, domestic consumers purchase less imported products, due to their higher costs.\n\nThese parallel actions ultimately shift the [trade balance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bot.asp), to present an increased surplus and smaller deficit, compared to those figures before the [devaluation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/devaluation.asp). Naturally, the same economic rationale applies to the opposite scenarios, where a country experiences a currency appreciation, which would consequently result in an inverted J Curve.\n\n<https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jcurve.asp>\n\n## Richard Thaler, Nobel Laureate 2017\n\n- Behavioral economics (analogy - bowl of cashews in party, removed, happy, otherwise kept eating)\n- Nudges\n\n## Paradox of Skill\n\nWhile someone may be improving on an absolute basis, they are often getting worse relative to their competition. Michael Mauboussin refers to this concept as the \"[Paradox of Skill](https://research-doc.credit-suisse.com/docView?language=ENG&format=PDF&source_id=em&document_id=805456950&serialid=LsvBuE4wt3XNGE0V%2B3ec251NK9soTQqcMVQ9q2QuF2I%3D)\", which simply means that even though people may becoming more skilled at a certain pursuit, it is oftenmoredifficult for them to succeed because their competition is also becoming more skilled. This means that eventually the most talented people end up competing against one another, making it very difficult to become a bonafide superstar. Hence the paradox.\n\n[How to make massive returns!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ms2gG27wyA)\n\n- The BCG Growth-Share matrix (BCG - Boston Consulting Group)\n  - The BCG growth-share matrix is a tool used internally by management to assess the current state of value of a firm's units or product lines.\n  - The growth-share matrix aids the company in deciding which products or units to either keep, sell, or invest more in.\n  - The BCG growth-share matrix contains four distinct categories: \"dogs,\" \"cash cows,\" \"stars,\" and \"question marks.\"\n\n<https://www.bcg.com/about/overview/our-history/growth-share-matrix>\n\n<https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bcg.asp>\n\n- Risk-Reward Equation should be positive.
