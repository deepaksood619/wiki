This rule became known asHobson's choice, and soon people were using that term to mean \"no choice at all\" in all kinds of situations.\n\n## Mitigating\n\n- (1)[Unintended Consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintended_consequences)--- \"Outcomes that are not the ones foreseen and intended by a purposeful action.\" (related:[collateral damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_damage)--- \"Deaths, injuries, or other damage inflicted on an unintended target.\", [Goodhart's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law)--- \"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure\";[Campbell's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law);**[Streisand Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect)---** \"The phenomenon whereby an attempt to hide, remove, or censor a piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the information more widely, usually facilitated by the Internet\";[cobra effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra_effect)--- \"when an attempted solution to a problem actually makes the problem worse.\"; \"Kick a hornet's nest.\")\n- (2)[Preserving Optionality](http://www.iheavy.com/2009/05/01/open-insights-55-preserving-optionality/)--- \"A strategy of keeping options open and fluid, fighting the urge to make choices too soon, before all of the uncertainties have been resolved.\" (related:[tyranny of small decisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_small_decisions)--- \"a situation where a series of small, individually rational decisions can negatively change the context of subsequent choices, even to the point where desired alternatives are irreversibly destroyed.\";[boiling frog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog)--- \"an anecdote describing a frog slowly being boiled alive.\";[path dependence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_dependence); \"Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\";[fog of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_of_war);[OODA loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop))\n- (2)[Precautionary Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle)--- \"If an action or policy has a suspected risk of causing harm to the public, or to the environment, in the absence of scientific consensus (that the action or policy is not harmful), the burden of proof that it is not harmful falls on those taking an action that may or may not be a risk.\"\n- (2)[Short-termism](http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=short_termism)--- \"Short-termism refers to an excessive focus on short-term results at the expense of long-term interests.\"\n\n## Influencing\n\n- (1)[Framing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_%28social_sciences%29)--- \"With the same information being used as a base, the 'frame' surrounding the issue can change the reader's perception without having to alter the actual facts.\" (related:[anchoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring))\n- (2)[Cialdini's Six Principles of Influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cialdini)---[Reciprocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_%28cultural_anthropology%29)(\"People tend to return a favor.\"), [Commitment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_%28negotiation%29)(\"If people commit...they are more likely to honor that commitment.\"), [Social Proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_proof)(\"People will do things they see other people are doing.\"), [Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority)(\"People will tend to obey authority figures.\"), Liking (\"People are easily persuaded by other people they like.\"), and [Scarcity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity)(\"Perceived scarcity will generate demand\").

The quotation is from [G. K. Chesterton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton)'s 1929 bookThe Thing, in the chapter entitled \"The Drift from Domesticity\":\n\nIn the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, \"I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away.\" To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: \"If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.\"\n\n## Do not remove a fence until you know why it was put up in the first place\n\nDon't change something until you know why it was there in the first place. It's also a way to look at reforms, and to understand the second order effects of an action.\n\n## Unless we know why someone made a decision, we can't safely change it or conclude that they were wrong\n\n<https://abovethelaw.com/2014/01/the-fallacy-of-chestertons-fence>\n\n<https://fs.blog/2020/03/chestertons-fence>\n\n## 50 Ideas\n\n- Doublespeak: People often say the opposite of what they mean, especially in political language. It allows people to lie while looking like they're telling the truth. As George Orwell famously wrote in 1984, \"War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.\"\n\n- Theory of Constraints: A system is only as strong as its weakest point. Focus on the bottleneck. Counterintuitively, if you break down the entire system and optimize each component individually, you'll lower the effectiveness of the system. Optimize the entire system instead.\n\n![image](media/Mental-Models-image2.jpg)\n\n- Preference Falsification: People lie about their true opinions and conform to socially acceptable preferences instead. In private they'll say one thing. In public, they'll say another.\n\n- Faustian Bargain: A man once sold his soul to a demon in exchange for knowledge. At first, it seemed like a smart trade. But the man lost in the long-run. Tragically, what the man lost was more valuable than what he earned. In short, he won the battle but lost the war.\n\n- Mimetic Theory of Desire: Humans are like sheep. We don't know what we want, so we imitate each other. Instead of creating our own desires, we desire the same things as other people. The entire advertising industry is built on this idea.\n\n- Mimetic Theory of Conflict: People who are similar are more likely to fight than people who are different. That's why Civil Wars and family feuds create the worst conflicts. The closer two people are and the more equality between them, the greater the potential for conflict.\n\n- Talent vs. Genius: Society is good at training talent but terrible at cultivating genius. Talented people are good at hitting targets others can't hit, but geniuses find targets others can't see. They are opposite modes of excellence. Talent is predictable, genius is unpredictable.\n\n- Competition is for Losers: Avoid competition. Stop copying what everybody else is doing. If you work at a for-profit company, work on problems that would not otherwise be solved. If you're at a non-profit, fix unpopular problems. Life is easier when you don't compete. (Hint: don't start another bottled water company)\n\n- Secrets are Hidden in Plain Sight: Most people think of secrets as Easter eggs. They assume that if a secret is important, it's necessarily going to be hard to find. The best ideas can come from things that are so well-known that they aren't well-seen.\n\n- The Never-Ending Now: The structure of our social media feeds blinds us to history, as it causes us to live in an endless cycle of ephemeral content consumption. The structure of the Internet pulls people away from age-old wisdom.\n\n- Demand Curves Slope Down: The harder something is to do, the fewer people will do it. For example, raise the price of a product and fewer people will buy it. Lower the price and more people will buy it. Economics 101.\n\n![image](media/Mental-Models-image3.jpg)\n\n- Look for Things That Don't Make Sense: The world always makes sense. But it can be confusing. When it is, your model of the world is wrong. So, things that don't make sense are a learning opportunity. Big opportunities won't make sense until it's too late to profit from them.\n\n- The Wisdom of Paradox: Logic is the key to scientific truths, but paradoxes are the key to psychological ones. When it comes to the human condition, the deepest truths are often counter-intuitive. When you find two opposites that are both true, start exploring.\n\n- Law of Shitty Click-Through Rates: Most marketing strategies have a short window of success, as click-through rates decrease as tactics mature. For example, the first banner-ad has a click-through rate of more than 70%. Now we avoid them with ad-blockers.\n\n- Russell Conjugation: Journalists often change the meaning of a sentence by replacing one word with a synonym that implies a different meaning. For example, the same person can support an estate tax but oppose a death tax - even though they are the same thing.\n\n- Overton Window: You can control thought without limiting speech. You can do it by defining the limits of acceptable thought while allowing for lively debate within these barriers. For example, Fox News and MSNBC set limits on what political thoughts they consider acceptable, but in the grand scheme of things, they're both fairly conventional. The political spectrum stretches far beyond the ideas they entertain, but ideas outside their limits are shunned.\n\n- Planck's Principle: Science doesn't progress because people change their views. Rather, each new generation of scientists has different views. As old generations pass away, new ideas are accepted and the scientific consensus changes.\n\n- Bike-Shed Effect: A group of people working on a project will fight over the most trivial ideas. They'll ignore what's complicated. They'll focus too much on easy-to-understand ideas at the expense of important, but hard to talk about ideas. For example, instead of approving plans for a complicated spaceship, the team would argue over the color of the astronaut's uniforms.\n\n- Table Selection: This idea comes from poker, where you're advised to choose your opponents carefully. That means you shouldn't compete against the best people. You don't need to get good at doing difficult things if you get good at avoiding difficult things. If you want to win, pick an easy table and nail your execution.\n\n- Goodhart's Law: When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. One hospital took too long to admit patients so a penalty was given for 4+ hour wait times. In response, ambulance drivers were asked to slow down so they could shorten wait times.\n\n- Gall's Law: A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.\n\n- Hock Principle: Simple, clear purpose and principles give rise to complex and intelligent behavior. Complex rules and regulations give rise to simple and stupid behavior.\n\n- Parkinson's Law: Work expands to fill the time available. People don't want to look like they're lazy, so they find extra tasks to tackle, even if they're trivial. If you have six months to complete a project, it will take six months to complete. Set deadlines accordingly.\n\n- The Second Law of Thermodynamics: The world tends towards disorder. That's why your room becomes messier and messier over time. It's also why an engine converts only ~35% of its energy into useful work. Time moves towards increasing one direction: increasing entropy.\n\n- The Paradox of Specificity: Focus isn't as constraining as it seems. In the age of the Internet, when everybody has Google search and personalized social media feeds, differentiation is free marketing. The more specific your goal, the more opportunities you'll create for yourself. Narrowing your aperture can expand your horizons.\n\n- Emergence: When things interact, they often birth new, unpredictable forms. Therefore, the sum total of a system is more than its component parts. As a system evolves, its structure can transform - just like how water becomes cold water until it turns into ice.\n\n- Occam's Razor: If there are multiple explanations for why something happened and they are equally persuasive, assume the simplest one is true. In the search for truth, remove unnecessary assumptions. Trust the lowest-complexity answer.\n\n- Hickam's Dictum: The opposite of Occam's Razor. In a complex system, problems usually have more than one cause. For example, in medicine, people can have many diseases at the same time.\n\n- Hormesis: A low dose of something can have the opposite effect of a high dose. A little bit of stress wakes you up, but a lot of stress is bad for you. Lifting weights for 30 minutes per day is good for you, but lifting weights for 6 hours per day will destroy your muscles. Stress yourself, but not too much.\n\n![image](media/Mental-Models-image4.jpg)\n\n- Robustness Principle: Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others. It's a design guideline for software and a good rule for life: Hold yourself to a higher standard than you hold others to.\n\n- Legibility: We are blind to what we cannot measure. Not everything that counts can be measured, and not everything that can be measured counts. But people manage what they can measure, so society repeats the same mistakes.\n\n- Horseshoe Theory: Extreme opposites tend to look the same. For example, a far-right movement and a far-left movement can be equally violent or desire a similar outcome. People on both sides are more similar to each other than they are to people in the center.\n\n![image](media/Mental-Models-image5.jpg)\n\n- Availability Cascade: A self-reinforcing cycle that creates collective beliefs. An idea will gain traction once it enters the mainstream, which triggers a chain reaction, which causes lots of people to adopt it not because it's true but because it's popular.\n\n- Creativity Begins at the Edge: Change starts away from the spotlight. Then, it moves towards the center. That's why the most interesting ideas at a conference never come from the main stage. They come from the hallways and the bar after sunset\n\n- The Copernican Principle: The more we learn about astronomy, the less it seems that earth is special. It's a small part of the universe, and each human is a small part of the earth. We are all spinning through the solar system - nowhere near the beginning or end of time.\n\n- Personal Monopoly: Corporations reward conformity, but the Internet rewards people who are unique. If you work in a creative field, strive to be the only person who does what you do. Find your own style, then run with it. Create intellectual real estate for yourself.\n\n- The Paradox of Consensus: Under ancient Jewish law, if a suspect was found guilty by every judge, they were deemed innocent. Too much agreement implied a systemic error in the judicial process. Unanimous agreement sometimes leads to bad decisions.\n\n- Penny Problem Gap: Economists assume demand is linear, but people's behavior totally changes once an action costs money. If the inventors of the Internet had known about it, spam wouldn't be such a problem. If sending an email cost you $0.001, there'd be way less spam.\n\n- The Invisible Hand: Markets aggregate knowledge. Rising prices signal falling supply or increased demand, which incentivizes an increase in production. The opposite is true for falling prices. Prices are a signal wrapped in an incentive.\n\n- Base Rate: The average outcome for an event over time. They're like batting averages for life, and they work best with big sample sizes. For example, if you're starting a business, avoid the restaurant business where margins are low and competition is high.\n\n- Circle of Competence: Define the limits of your knowledge. Hint: the limits are smaller than you think. That's because being an expert in one area doesn't make you an expert in anything else. Be clear about what you know and don't know.\n\n![image](media/Mental-Models-image6.jpg)\n\n- Convexity: If you want to be lucky, look for opportunities with big upsides and low downsides. In addition to increased optionality, your errors will benefit you more than they harm you. Convex payoffs let you tinker your way to success and innovation.\n\n![image](media/Mental-Models-image7.jpg)\n\n- The Go-For-It Window: Large gaps between accelerating technologies and stagnating social norms create lucrative new business opportunities. But they are only available for a short time when people can capitalize on the difference between the real and perceived state of the world. For example, 2007 was the perfect time to launch the iPhone, but Google Glasses launched too early.\n\n- Via Negativa: When we have a problem, our natural instinct is to add a new habit or purchase a fix. But sometimes, you can improve your life by taking things away. For example, the foods you avoid are more important than the foods you eat.\n\n- The Medium Is the Message: We pay too much attention to what is being said. But the medium of communication is more impactful. For example, the Internet's impact on humanity has a bigger influence than anything that's said on the Internet.\n\n- Resource Curse: Countries with an abundance of natural resources such as diamonds and fossil fuels tend to have less economic growth and worse development than countries with fewer natural resources.\n\n- The Paradox of Abundance: The average quality of information is getting worse and worse. But the best stuff is getting better and better. Markets of abundance are simultaneously bad for the median consumer but good for conscious consumers.\n\n- The Map Is Not the Territory: Reality will never match the elegance of theory. All models have inconsistencies, but some are still useful. Some maps are useful because they're inaccurate. If you want to find an edge, look for what the map leaves out.\n\n- Baker's Dozen: The key to good hospitality is to delight your guests with an unexpected gift. If you run a hotel, leave a chocolate on the bed. If you run a bakery, give your customers one extra bagel. If you write a tweetstorm, share an extra idea.\n\n- Mimesis: we mimic each other in our desires\n\nThe default cycle of mimetic desire leads people to want what other people have, and eventually leads to rivalry and conflict. But desires can be mimetic in tremendously positive ways. Heroism is mimetic - we saw it on 9/11. When a firefighter runs into a burning building, it might become a little easier for the second and third to run in.\n\nWe're inspired by people who take a stand for what they believe in, who refuse to give in; we're inspired by people who demonstrate extreme empathy and vulnerability. That, too, is mimetic. When we see it in others, it makes us want to be more like that.\n\nWe can start a positive cycle of desire for ourselves even in simple things, like fitness. It's like turning a giant flywheel, which builds momentum as we go. One turn of the flywheel might work like this: I commit to showing up for my workouts with my highly disciplined friend, who holds me accountable if I don't; which makes me want to eat well so that I have enough energy for our workouts; which makes me want to wake up....\"\n\n<https://www.perell.com/blog/50-ideas-that-changed-my-life>\n\n## Principle of reasonable accommodation\n\n## Reasonable accommodationis a principle that promotes equality, enables the grant of positive rights and prevents discrimination based ondisability, health condition or personal belief\n\n## Systemic bias\n\nSystemic bias, also calledinstitutional bias, is the inherent tendency of a process to support particular outcomes. The term generally refers to human systems such as institutions; the equivalent bias in non-human systems (such as measurement instruments or [mathematical models](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Computational_mechanics) used to estimate physical quantities) is often called [systematic bias](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Systematic_bias), and leads to [systematic error](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Systematic_error) in measurements or estimates. The issues of systemic bias are dealt with extensively in the field of [industrial organization](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Industrial_organization) economics.\n\n## Human Capital Theory\n\nHuman capitalis the stock of [habits](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Habit), [knowledge](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Knowledge), [social](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Social) and [personality](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Personality) attributes (including [creativity](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Creativity)) embodied in the ability to perform labour so as to produce [economic value](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Economic_value).\n\nHuman capital is unique and differs from any other capital. It is needed for companies to achieve goals, develop and remain innovative. Companies can invest in human capital for example through education and training enabling improved levels of quality and production.\n\n<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Human_capital>\n\n## Hedonic Treadmill / Hedonic Adaptation\n\nThehedonic treadmill, also known ashedonic adaptation, is the observed tendency of [humans](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Human) to quickly return to a relatively stable level of [happiness](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Happiness) despite major positive or negative events or life changes.According to this theory, as a person makes more money, expectations and desires rise in tandem, which results in no permanent gain in happiness.\n\n<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hedonic_treadmill>\n\n<https://www.coglode.com/research/hedonic-adaptation>\n\n## Zeigarnik Effect\n\nIt's the tendency of our brains to dwell on unfinished tasks. And if you leave in the middle of a financial plan, it could create stress. That stress could push you into restarting the plan again. But since it requires far more effort than bingeing on a TV show, you put it off again. And the stress builds up and paralyses you into inactivity. It's a vicious cycle.\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeigarnik_effect>\n\n## Certainty Effect\n\n![image](media/Mental-Models-image8.png)\n\n![image](media/Mental-Models-image9.png)\n\n<https://www.coglode.com/story/offsetting-painful-loss-with-reassuring-certainty>\n\nDecision making is hard.\n\nPeople really never have enough information to make an educated guess.\n\nTherefore people use intuition to make decisions.\n\nBut intuitions can lead to mistakes.\n\n2008 financial crisis.\n\n<https://collabfund.com/blog/little-ways-the-world-works>\n\n[What Investors can Learn from other Disciplines | Biology, Astrophysics, Statistics, etc | ET Money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d4tYdhE8mY)\n\n## EVOLUTION - MULLER'S RATCHET\n\nWhat the theory says is that the evolution of any species is severely hampered in the absence of variety. So for instance, if the same genetics of the parent is exactly passed on, to the offspring which is then passed to their offspring then there is no genetic recombination here and this can lead to dangerous mutations ultimately leading to extinction. When we apply this to modern day commerce the Muller's ratchet is exactly what happens in closed societies and large corporations. There is a resistance to change, there are no new ideas, bad habits tend to stick, there is lethargy which eventually brings about the business's downfall.\n\n## ASTROPHYSICS - BENFORD'S LAW OF CONTROVERSY\n\nBenford's law of controversy is not really a law but it's more of an adage that says - \"Passion is inversely proportional to the amount of real information available\". So there are two ways to look at this. Firstly, the theory says that the fewer facts one knows, the more interesting the topic becomes. And secondly, when one is given the opportunity to fill information gaps with rumors, theories and imagination people tend to cling onto what they want to be true which more-often-than-not is something they are passionate about.\n\nIf we have data, let's look at data. If all we have are opinions, let's go with mine\n\n## BIOLOGY - COPE'S RULE\n\nCope's Rule postulates that species often evolve to get bigger bodies over time. And this happens for the simple reason that there are many competitive advantages to being big. But size also has its drawbacks in the form of requiring more food per unit of body mass, being unable to hide, having a slow reproductive process etc. which can often be amongst the primary causes of their extinction. In other words the same force that pushes you to become big can also lead to you dying or going extinct.\n\nWhen we connect this with investing, I'm sure we can visualize a similar life cycle for most companies and industries. Similarly, large businesses get favourable terms, the advantage of economies of scale and a strong brand name\n\n## STATISTICS : STATIONARITY\n\nPlainly speaking, \"stationarity\" says that the past is a statistical guide to the future which is another way of saying that the big forces that impact a system don't change over time. For example - if you want to know how many people are going to die next year, then an examination of the last 100 years of actuarial tables should do the trick. Now from an investing standpoint, this concept of stationarity is the bedrock principle for quant based investment managers. I mean, at the core of every quant-based model is the assumption that there are patterns in the stock markets that have prevailed in the past and those patterns will also prevail in the future and this steadiness can be used to make money in the financial markets. However, as wonderful and scientific stationarity might seem it has a tendency to work, right up until the moment it doesn't. It's a bit like stationarity meeting a black swan event like what we saw with the Covid19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine or China pulling the plug on its Internet companies etc. which can come as major unfactored surprises. Infact, Scott Sagan - a professor at Stanford University said it best when he said \"Things that have never happened before happen all the time\".\n\n## AGRONOMY - LIEBIG'S LAW OF THE MINIMUM\n\nAgronomy is nothing but the study of agriculture and Liebig's law of the minimum says that a plant's growth is limited not by its total but by it's most scarcest nutrient. For example if you were to give a plant everything except nitrogen or water then the plant is going nowhere. Likewise, if the soil has a mix of different nutrients, Liebig's law says that the crop yield will be only as good as the availability of the least abundant nutrient in the soil. This concept is highly relatable to business and investing frameworks where one bad bank or one broken supply chain can ruin an entire system's trajectory.\n\n## Absorption rates (biology, geology, chemistry)\n\nThere is a natural limit to how fast something can grow, governed by how fast it can absorb certain nutrients. But different organisms have massively different absorption rates despite being delivered nutrients at the same rate, so you can get vastly different outcomes despite feeding something the same nutrients. Same with education, career success, and social networks -- some people are primed to absorb much more than others, even when they are part of the same system.\n\n## Tocqueville Paradox (sociology)\n\nPeople's expectations rise faster than living standards, so a society that becomes exponentially wealthier can see a decline in net happiness and satisfaction. There is virtually nothing people can't get accustomed to, which also helps explain why there is so much desire for innovation and improvement.\n\n## Three Men Make a Tiger (Chinese proverb)\n\nIf one person tells you there's a tiger roaming around your neighborhood, you can assume they're lying. If two people tell you, you begin to wonder. If three say it's true, you're convinced there's a tiger in your neighborhood and you run for your life. The proverb first came about hundreds of years ago, but is probably more relevant than ever in the social media age. People will believe anything if enough people tell them it's true.\n","excerpt":"Mental Models Mental Models in Science Biology Evolution by Natural Selection Equilibrium (Homeostasis) Heredity
