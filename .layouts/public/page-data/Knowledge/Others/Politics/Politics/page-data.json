By respecting international laws and norms -- like, say, a UN resolution -- a humane authority sets a good example to other states. In modern history, US president Franklin D. Roosevelt could be considered an example of this kind of leadership. He demonstrated this during his presidency when the US played a leading role in liberating countries occupied by Nazi Germany. He also helped lay the groundwork for the establishment of the United Nations.\n\nSecondly, we come to**hegemonic leadership**. This is a type of dominant leadership that's trustworthy -- but follows a double standard. To its allies, it's helpful and trustworthy, but to its rivals, it's ruthless and doesn't abide by international norms. The leaderships of the US and the Soviet Union during the period of the Cold War could be considered hegemonic.\n\nThen, we come to what the author calls**anemocratic leadership.** This type of leadership is both untrustworthyandfollows a double standard in its international behavior. This type of leadership doesn't follow international norms, and often acts in a contradictory and confused manner. Because of its lack of moral foundation, it's usually perceived as having zero credibility -- even with its allies. Some American scholars consider Donald Trump's leadership to be a classic example of anemocracy.\n\nLastly, we come to**tyrannical leadership**.When a leadership is untrustworthyandconsistent in its untrustworthiness, it's considered tyrannic. This kind of leadership has no moral restraint in the pursuit of its goals, and is feared and distrusted by both ally and rival alike. When a tyrannical state becomestheworld's dominant state, moral norms perish rather than expand. Adolf Hitler's fascist Germany and Japan's militarist government during World War II are both considered tyrannies.\n\nOut of these four leadership styles, humane authority is best placed to create a stable international order. By embracing moral values, a humane authority will gain international credibility and be able to muster support for its ideas and reforms.\n\n## Schools of Thoughts\n\n- Idealism\n- Realism (Neorealism)\n- Just war theory\n- Dharma in foreign policy\n\n## Marxism\n\nMarxismis a method of [socioeconomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic) analysis that uses a [materialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialist) interpretation of historical development, better known as [historical materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_materialism), to understand [class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class) relations and [social conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_conflict) as well as a [dialectical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic) perspective to view [social transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_transformation). It originates from the works of 19th-century German philosophers [Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx) and [Friedrich Engels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Engels). As Marxism has developed over time into various branches and [schools of thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schools_of_thought), there is currently no single definitive [Marxist theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist_philosophy).\n\nSome [Marxist schools of thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist_schools_of_thought) place greater emphasis on certain aspects of [classical Marxism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Marxism) while rejecting or modifying other aspects. Some schools have sought to combine Marxian concepts and non-Marxian concepts which has then led to contradictory conclusions.It has been argued that there is a movement toward the recognition of [historical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_materialism) and [dialectical materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism) as the fundamental conceptions of all Marxist schools of thought.This view is rejected by some [post-Marxists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Marxism) such as [Ernesto Laclau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernesto_Laclau) and [Chantal Mouffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chantal_Mouffe), who claim that history is not only determined by the [mode of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_of_production) but also by consciousness and will.\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism>\n\n<https://www.e-ir.info/2018/02/25/introducing-marxism-in-international-relations-theory>\n\n## ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)\n\n[Indonesia](https://www.google.com/search?q=Indonesia&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOPgE-LQz9U3KMxLK1MCs4yLKvO09DPKrfST83NyUpNLMvPz9HNTc5NSi4ozMgvi84vSE_MyqxJB4sVWUIlFrJyeeSn5eanFmYkATdfNaVMAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjc79H5zJjhAhVJQo8KHa_tBwQQmxMoATAaegQIDBAl), [Thailand](https://www.google.com/search?q=Thailand&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOPgE-LQz9U3KMxLK1MCs8zTDCu09DPKrfST83NyUpNLMvPz9HNTc5NSi4ozMgvi84vSE_MyqxJB4sVWUIlFrBwhGYmZOYl5KQCcnvE1UgAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjc79H5zJjhAhVJQo8KHa_tBwQQmxMoAjAaegQIDBAm), [Malaysia](https://www.google.com/search?q=Malaysia&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOPgE-LQz9U3KMxLK1PiBLEsC3Kzy7T0M8qt9JPzc3JSk0sy8_P0c1Nzk1KLijMyC-Lzi9IT8zKrEkHixVZQiUWsHL6JOYmVxZmJAJCgcytTAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjc79H5zJjhAhVJQo8KHa_tBwQQmxMoAzAaegQIDBAn), [Singapore](https://www.google.com/search?q=Singapore&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOPgE-LQz9U3KMxLK1MCs8xKjEq09DPKrfST83NyUpNLMvPz9HNTc5NSi4ozMgvi84vSE_MyqxJB4sVWUIlFrJzBmXnpiQX5RakAQLdNv1MAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjc79H5zJjhAhVJQo8KHa_tBwQQmxMoBDAaegQIDBAo), [Philippines](https://www.google.com/search?q=Philippines&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOPgE-LQz9U3KMxLK1MCs0zLLJK19DPKrfST83NyUpNLMvPz9HNTc5NSi4ozMgvi84vSE_MyqxJB4sVWUIlFrNwBGZk5mQUFmXmpxQBQgZaQVQAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjc79H5zJjhAhVJQo8KHa_tBwQQmxMoBTAaegQIDBAp), [Vietnam](https://www.google.com/search?q=Vietnam&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOPgE-LQz9U3KMxLK1PiBLEMk4tSTLX0M8qt9JPzc3JSk0sy8_P0c1Nzk1KLijMyC-Lzi9IT8zKrEkHixVZQiUWs7GGZqSV5ibkARlh_aFIAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjc79H5zJjhAhVJQo8KHa_tBwQQmxMoBjAaegQIDBAq), [Cambodia](https://www.google.com/search?q=Cambodia&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOPgE-LQz9U3KMxLK1PiBLEMK5LSK7T0M8qt9JPzc3JSk0sy8_P0c1Nzk1KLijMyC-Lzi9IT8zKrEkHixVZQiUWsHM6JuUn5KZmJAHJFpqpTAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjc79H5zJjhAhVJQo8KHa_tBwQQmxMoBzAaegQIDBAr), [Brunei](https://www.google.com/search?q=Brunei&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOPgE-LQz9U3KMxLK1MCswzNzMu09DPKrfST83NyUpNLMvPz9HNTc5NSi4ozMgvi84vSE_MyqxJB4sVWUIlFrGxORaV5qZkAah8-ZFAAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjc79H5zJjhAhVJQo8KHa_tBwQQmxMoCDAaegQIDBAs), [Myanmar (Burma)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Myanmar&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOPgE-LQz9U3KMxLK1MCs0wq8uK19DPKrfST83NyUpNLMvPz9HNTc5NSi4ozMgvi84vSE_MyqxJB4sVWUIlFrOy-lYl5uYlFABOulxxRAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjc79H5zJjhAhVJQo8KHa_tBwQQmxMoCTAaegQIDBAt), [Laos](https://www.google.com/search?q=Laos&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAOPgE-LQz9U3KMxLK1MCs0wyMsq09DPKrfST83NyUpNLMvPz9HNTc5NSi4ozMgvi84vSE_MyqxJB4sVWUIlFrCw-ifnFAFRUTElOAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjc79H5zJjhAhVJQo8KHa_tBwQQmxMoCjAaegQIDBAu)\n\n## Deterrence & Coersion\n\n1.

In it, he marvels at homeless encampments in the streets of Washington DC, out-of-control drug crime in poor black neighborhoods in New York and San Francisco, and corporations that seemed to have fused themselves to and taken over responsibilities of government. Eventually, he concludes that America faces an \"unstoppable undercurrent of crisis\" produced by its societal contradictions, including between rich and poor, white and black, democratic and oligarchic power, egalitarianism and class privilege, individual rights and collective responsibilities, cultural traditions and the solvent of liquid modernity.\n\n\"The real cell of society in the United States is the individual,\" he finds. This is so because the cell most foundational (per Aristotle) to society, \"the family, has disintegrated.\" Meanwhile, in the American system, \"everything has a dual nature, and the glamour of high commodification abounds. Human flesh, sex, knowledge, politics, power, and law can all become the target of commodification.\" This \"commodification, in many ways, corrupts society and leads to a number of serious social problems.\" In the end, \"the American economic system has created human loneliness\" as its foremost product, along with spectacular inequality. As a result, \"nihilism has become the American way, which is a fatal shock to cultural development and the American spirit.\"\n\n## demagogues\n\na political leader who seeks support by appealing to
