Everything goes there. Additionally, it dumpsglobalthings -- roles and tablespaces, which cannot be dumped by pg_dump.\n\nThe major benefit of pg_dumpall is that it's single command, and you get results.\n\nThere is huge number of drawbacks though:\n\n- dump is large, because it's uncompressed\n- dumping is slow, because it's done sequentially, with single worker\n- it's hard to restore just parts of dump\n\n## pg_dump\n\npg_dump, on the other hand, can't dump globals, and can dump only one database at a time. But it can use four dump formats:\n\n- plain\n- custom\n- directory\n- tar\n\nPlain is just plain text format, just like pg_dumpall dumps. You can load it with psql, and extracting parts can be complicated if dump is large.\n\nAll other formats (custom, directory, and tar) are restored using pg_restore program.\n\n## Adding hstore in database\n\n```sql\npsql -U postgres template1\ncreate extension hstore;\nq\n```\n\nCannot use `--keepdb` after this, since new db is to be created\n\n<https://www.depesz.com/2019/12/10/how-to-effectively-dump-postgresql-databases>\n","excerpt":"Postgres Commands brew install postgresql psql - start postgres sql query engine psql has a
