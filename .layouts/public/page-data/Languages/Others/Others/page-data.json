This makes it very robust and a good choice for a lot of different product requirements.\n\nDart is quite unique in this regard. It supports transpilation into JavaScript, a standalone VM which offers just-in-time compilation and, finally, ahead of time compilation into platform native instruction sets which allows the best performance for delivering production-ready solutions.\n\nThe Dart programming language is important for a few reasons\n\n- It has the best of both worlds: It's a compiled, type-safe language (like C# and Java) and a scripting language (like Python and JavaScript) at the same time.\n- It transpiles to JavaScript for use as a web front end.\n- It runs on everything, and [compiles to native mobile apps](https://www.toptal.com/flutter/flutter-tutorial), so you can use it for nearly anything.\n- [Dart](https://www.toptal.com/dart) is similar to [C#](https://www.toptal.com/c-sharp) and [Java](https://www.toptal.com/java) in syntax, so it's quick to learn.\n\n<https://www.toptal.com/dart/dartlang-guide-for-csharp-java-devs>\n\n## dhall-lang\n\nDhall is a programmable configuration language that provides a non-repetitive alternative to YAML.\n\nYou can think of Dhall as: JSON + functions + types + imports\n\nNote that while Dhall is programmable, Dhall is not Turing-complete. Many of Dhall's features take advantage of this restriction to provide stronger safety guarantees and more powerful tooling.\n\n<https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang>\n\n## Apache Groovy\n\nApache Groovyis a [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))-syntax-compatible [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)[programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) for the [Java platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(software_platform)). It is both a static and [dynamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language) language with features similar to those of [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)), and [Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk). It can be used as both a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) and a [scripting language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language) for the Java Platform, is compiled to [Java virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine)(JVM)[bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode), and interoperates seamlessly with other Java code and [libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)). Groovy uses a [curly-bracket syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curly_bracket_programming_language) similar to Java's. Groovy supports [closures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)), multiline strings, and [expressions embedded in strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interpolation). Much of Groovy's power lies in its [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) transformations, triggered through annotations.\n\n[Apache](http://www.apache.org/) Groovy is apowerful, optionally typedanddynamiclanguage, withstatic-typing and static compilationcapabilities, for the Java platform aimed at improving developer productivity thanks to a concise, familiar and easy to learn syntax. It integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-Specific Languageauthoring, runtime and compile-timemeta-programmingandfunctionalprogramming.\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Groovy>\n\n<http://groovy-lang.org>\n\n## darklang\n\nA language built for deployless backends.\n\nDark is a holistic programming language, editor, and infrastructure for building backends without accidental complexity.\n\n<https://darklang.com>\n\n<https://darklang.com/a/deepaksood619>\n\n<https://darklang.github.io/docs/docs/getting-started>\n\n<https://darklang.github.io/docs/docs/react-spa-tutorial>\n\n<https://darklang.github.io/docs/docs/slack-app-tutorial>\n\n## Gremlin\n\nGremlinis a [graph traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_traversal) language and [virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) developed by Apache TinkerPop of the [Apache Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Software_Foundation). Gremlin works for both [OLTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_transaction_processing)-based graph databases as well as [OLAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing)-based graph processors. Gremlin's [automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory) and [functional language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) foundation enable Gremlin to naturally support [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) and [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) querying, host language agnosticism, user-defined [domain specific languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language), an extensible compiler/optimizer, single- and multi-machine execution models, hybrid depth- and breadth-first evaluation, as well as [Turing Completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Complete).\n\nAs an explanatory analogy, Apache TinkerPop and Gremlin are to [graph databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_databases) what the [JDBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Database_Connectivity) and [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) are to [relational databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDBMS). Likewise, the Gremlin traversal machine is to graph computing as what the [Java virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) is to general purpose computing.\n\n<http://tinkerpop.apache.org>\n\n<https://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlin.html>\n\n<http://sql2gremlin.com>\n\n<https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki>\n\n## Kotlin\n\n<https://www.toptal.com/kotlin/kotlin-server-side-development>\n\n## Closure\n\nClojure a dialect of LISP that was originally meant to compile to JVM. It was further extended to ClojureScript, a version of Clojure that compiles to JavaScript.\n\nClojure is a dynamic, general-purpose programming language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure is a compiled language, yet remains completely dynamic -- every feature supported by Clojure is supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection.\n\nClojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures. When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that ensure clean, correct, multithreaded designs.\n\nLanguages like Python focus on readability by making the code look like the English language. LISPs, on the other hand, ignore the English language semantics completely and enforce a structural syntax.\n\nAll LISP code is a list of primitives. Primitive being an element in the set of vector, map, string, number or symbol. The acronym LISP stands forListProcessing. Your code is basically a tree with LISP.\n\n- Immutability\n- Compiles to JVM and JS (and Graal)\n- REPL Driven Development\n- Relatively more succinct and productive\n- Not typed, but spec'd\n- Clojurists don't fix something that isn't broken\n- Macros\n\nWhy Clojure sucks\n\n- It's hard to find engineers\n- It's closely controlled by Rich Hickey & Cognitect\n- (It's (flooded with (parenthesis)))\n- It's has a slow startup time\n- It's has a steep learning curve\n\n<https://medium.com/swlh/what-i-learned-after-writing-clojure-for-424-days-straight-8884ec471f8e>\n\nReading - <https://www.braveclojure.com>\n\n<https://clojure.org>\n\n<https://clojure.org/about/rationale>\n\n## datalog\n\nDatalogis a [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming)[logic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming) language that syntactically is a subset of [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog). It is often used as a [query language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_language) for [deductive databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_database). In recent years, Datalog has found new application in [data integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integration), [information extraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_extraction), [networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network), [program analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_analysis), [security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security), [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) and [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning).\n\nIts origins date back to the beginning of [logic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming), but it became prominent as a separate area around 1977 when [Hervé Gallaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herv%C3%A9_Gallaire&action=edit&redlink=1) and [Jack Minker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Minker) organized a workshop on [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic) and [databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database).[David Maier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Maier) is credited with coining the term Datalog.\n\n[Datalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog) is\n\n- a declarative logic language in which each formula is a function-free Horn clause, and every variable in the head of a clause must appear in the body of the clause.\n- a lightweight deductive database system where queries and database updates are expressed in the logic language.\n\nThe use of Datalog syntax and an implementation based on tabling intermediate results ensures that all queries terminate.\n\nDatalog is a deductive query system combining a database of facts (the Datomic db) with a set of rules for deriving new facts from existing facts and other rules. This query capability is combined with a powerful hierarchical selection facility, so you can recover tree-like data without joins or complex re-assembly. Datalog with negation is of equivalent power to relational algebra with recursion. Datalog is a great fit for application queries thanks to:\n\n- Pattern-matching like structure, in which joins are implicit\n- Recursion is much more straightforward than in SQL\n- Datalog rules subsume SQL views, but have more of a logic feel, allowing a closer alignment to business rules\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog>\n\n<https://docs.racket-lang.org/datalog>\n\n## Racket\n\nRacket is a [general-purpose programming language](https://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/index.html) as well as the [world's first ecosystem](http://felleisen.org/matthias/manifesto/) for language-oriented programming.\n\n<https://racket-lang.org>\n\n## DPC++ / oneAPI\n\nData Parallel C++, or DPC++ for short, is a C-based open-source alternative to proprietary programming languages typically used to code for specific types of hardware, such as GPUs or FFPGAs.\n\nIntel oneAPI is a single, unified programming model that aims to simplify development across different hardware architectures: CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, AI accelerators, and more.\n\n<https://www.toptal.com/c-plus-plus/intel-oneapi-dpc-plus-plus>\n\n## Halide\n\nA language for fast, portable computation on images and [tensors](https://twitter.com/jrk/status/837788386718994432)\n\nHalide is a programming language designed to make it easier to write high-performance image and array processing code on modern machines. Halide currently targets:\n\n- CPU architectures: X86, ARM, MIPS, Hexagon, PowerPC\n- Operating systems: Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Qualcomm QuRT\n- GPU Compute APIs: CUDA, OpenCL, OpenGL, OpenGL Compute Shaders, Apple Metal, Microsoft Direct X 12\n\nRather than being a standalone programming language, Halide is embedded in C++. This means you write C++ code that builds an in-memory representation of a Halide pipeline using Halide's C++ API. You can then compile this representation to an object file, or JIT-compile it and run it in the same process.\n\n<http://halide-lang.org>\n\n## Julia\n\n## Juliais a [high-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language)[general-purpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language)[dynamic programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language) that was originally designed to address the needs of high-performance [numerical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis) and [computational science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_science), without the typical need of [separate compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler#Compiler_construction) to be fast, also usable for client and server web use, low-level [systems programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_programming) or as a [specification language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_language)\n\nDistinctive aspects of Julia's design include a type system with [parametric polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism) and types in a fully [dynamic programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language) and [multiple dispatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch) as its core [programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm). It allows [concurrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing), [parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing) and [distributed computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing), and [direct calling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface) of [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) and [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran) libraries without [glue code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern#gluecode).\n\nJulia is [garbage-collected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)), uses [eager evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eager_evaluation) and includes efficient libraries for [floating-point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point) calculations, [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra), [random number generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation), and [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) matching. Many libraries are available, and some of them (e.g. for [fast Fourier transforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform)) were previously bundled with Julia.\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_(programming_language)>\n\n<https://towardsdatascience.com/bye-bye-python-hello-julia-9230bff0df62>\n\n## Flux\n\nFlux is a lightweight scripting language for querying databases (like InfluxDB) and working with data. It's part of InfluxDB 1.7 and 2.0, but can be run independently of those.\n\n1. Comments\n\n2. Named arguments\n\n3. String Literals\n\n4. Buckets\n\n5. Duration Literal\n\n6. Time Literal\n\n7. Pipe forward operator\n\n8. Anonymous function\n\n9. Predicate function\n\n<https://www.influxdata.com/blog/why-were-building-flux-a-new-data-scripting-and-query-language>\n\n<https://github.com/influxdata/flux>\n\n<https://docs.influxdata.com/flux/v0.7>\n\n<https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2>\n\n[Flux and InfluxDB 2.0](https://www.slideshare.net/influxdata/flux-and-influxdb-20)\n\n## V / Vlang\n\nSimple, fast, safe, compiled language for developing maintainable software. Supports translation from C and (soon) C++. Compiles itself in <1s.\n\n## Key Features of V\n\n- Simplicity: the language can be learned in half an hour, less if you already know Go\n- Fast compilation: ~100k loc/s right now, ~1.2 million loc/s once x64 generation is mature enough\n- Easy to develop: V compiles itself in less than a second\n- Performance: within 5% of C\n- Safety: no null, no globals, no undefined behavior, immutability by default\n- C to V translation\n- Hot code reloading\n- Powerful UI and graphics libraries\n- Easy cross compilation\n- REPL\n\n<https://github.com/vlang/v>\n\n<https://vlang.io>\n","excerpt":"Others
