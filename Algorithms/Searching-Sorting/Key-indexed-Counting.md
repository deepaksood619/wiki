## Proporties
-   Linear time algorithm for sorting
-   Stable

## Key-Indexed Counting

Assumption - Keys are integers between 0 and R-1

Implication - Can use key as an array index

Applications
-   Sort string by first letter.
-   Sort class roster by section.
-   Sort phone numbers by area code.
-   Subroutine in a sorting algorithm.

Remarks - Keys may have associated data => can't just count up number of keys of each value (because we have to transfer the data as well)
