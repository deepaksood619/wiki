For all elements -
-   In iteration i, find index min of smallest remaining element
-   Swap a[i] and a[min]



![public class Selection public static void a) int N = a. length; for (int i = int min = i for (int J if min = j; exch(a, i, min); private static boolean less(Comparab1e v, Comparable w) / * as before * / private static void / * as before * / a, int i, int j) ](media/Selection-Sort-image1.png)



Proposition - Selection sort uses ~ N^2^ / 2 compares (Quadratic) and N exchanges (Linear)

Running time - Quadratic time, even if input is sorted

Number of exchanges - Linear, at max n exchanges
