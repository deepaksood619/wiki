In [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory), **Fermat's Last Theorem**(sometimes called**Fermat's conjecture**, especially in older texts) states that no three [positive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_number)[integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer)*a*,*b*, and*c*satisfy the equation*a^n^*+*b^n^*=*c^n^*for any integer value of*n*greater than 2. The cases*n*= 1and*n*= 2have been known to have infinitely many solutions since antiquity.
