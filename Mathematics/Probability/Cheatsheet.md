For example, pnorm, qnorm, and rnorm can be used to get the CDP, quantiles, and random generation for the Normal. For the Multinomial, dmultinom can be used for calculating the joint P MF and rmultinom can be used for generating random vectors. For the Multivariate Normal, after installing and loading the mvtnorm package dmvnorm can be used for calculating the joint PDF and rmvnorm can be used for generating random vectors. ](media/Cheatsheet-image10.jpg){width="5.0in" height="6.4375in"}
