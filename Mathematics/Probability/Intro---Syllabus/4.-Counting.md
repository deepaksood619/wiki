The basic principle of counting, uses it to count subsets, permutations, combinations, and partitions, and applies it to some probability problems.

![A coin tossing problem Given that there were 3 heads in 10 tosses, what is the probability that the first two tosses were heads? the first 2 tosses were heads event B: 3 out of 10 tosses were heads event First solution: E (Hi omc H 40>scs 8 8 ](media/Intro---Syllabus_4.-Counting-image8.png)
In above solution, H1 H2 and one H in tosses 3,..,10 are independent of each other, therefore probability of two independent events are the product of there individual proabablities.
