Introduces the concepts of independence of two events, independence of multiple events, and pairwise independence, together with examples related to coin tossing and system reliability.
![A model based 3 tosses of a on conditional probabilities biased coin: P(H) = p, P(T) = 1 Multiplication rule: Total probability: E (Ha J H,) 2 P: ?

In the above example, the probability of the first coin toss didn't effect the probabilities what might happen in the second coin toss. This is called independence.
![Independence of two events • Intuitive "definition": P (B I A) P (B) occurrence of A provides no new information about B B) = P(A) • PCB) Definition of independence: Symmetric with respect to A and B --- implies P (A I B) P (A) applies even if P(Ä) = O 13 Independent? ](media/Intro---Syllabus_3.-Independence-image2.png)
In the above set example, the two disjoint sets A and B are dependent on each other, because if A occured than we are sure that B doesn't occurred and vice-versa.
![Independence of event complements Definition of independence: If and B are independent, --- Intuitive argument then and BC are independent. Formal proof 2 (40B) + L (b) + t [Atl BC) 2 (A) 2(4) (I - 2 ](media/Intro---Syllabus_3.-Independence-image3.png)
![Conditional independence Conditional independence, given C, is defined as independence under the probability law I C) Assume A and B are independent If we are told that C occurred, are and B independent? flJÖ ](media/Intro---Syllabus_3.-Independence-image4.png)

In the last image, if C occurred, then A and B are disjoint, therefore we know that if A occurred after C than B definitely didn't occur and vice-versa. Therefore A and B are not independent.

Both are disjoint, therefore using additivity axiom
