Angular templates are *dynamic*. When Angular renders them, it transforms the DOM according to the instructions given bydirectives.

A directive is a class with a@[Directive](https://angular.io/api/core/Directive) decorator. A component is a*directive-with-a-template*; a@[Component](https://angular.io/api/core/Component) decorator is actually a@[Directive](https://angular.io/api/core/Directive) decorator extended with template-oriented features.

Whilea component is technically a directive, components are so distinctive and central to Angular applications that this architectural overview separates components from directives.

Two *other*kinds of directives exist:*structural*and*attribute*directives.

They tend to appear within an element tag as attributes do, sometimes by name but more often as the target of an assignment or a binding.

Structuraldirectives alter layout by adding, removing, and replacing elements in DOM.

The [example template](https://angular.io/guide/architecture#templates) uses two built-in structural directives:

## <li *[ngFor](https://angular.io/api/common/NgForOf)="let hero of heroes"></li>

## <app-hero-detail *[ngIf](https://angular.io/api/common/NgIf)="selectedHero"></app-hero-detail>

- [*ngFor](https://angular.io/guide/displaying-data#ngFor) tells Angular to stamp out one<li>per hero in theheroeslist.
- [*ngIf](https://angular.io/guide/displaying-data#ngIf) includes theHeroDetailcomponent only if a selected hero exists.

Other Directives -

- ngSwitch
- ngStyle
- ngClass

Attributedirectives alter the appearance or behavior of an existing element. In templates they look like regular HTML attributes, hence the name.

The [ngModel](https://angular.io/api/forms/NgModel) directive, which implements two-way data binding, is an example of an attribute directive.[ngModel](https://angular.io/api/forms/NgModel) modifies the behavior of an existing element (typically an `<input>`) by setting its display value property and responding to change events.
