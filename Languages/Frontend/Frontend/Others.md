**Performance**
-   **Steps to build a hyper-light website**

    1.  **Identify** the most active page on your website

    2.  **Build** a new version of that page from scratch with a singular focus on optimization

    3.  **Assemble** all the HTML,CSS and JS into a single "hyper-light" HTML page

    4.  **Serve** the hyper-light page behind a CDN with compression and HTTP/2 pipelining

    5.  **Measure** both the original page, uncached, and the hyper-light page

    6.  **Analyze** the results
-   **Things you want to KEEP doing**
    -   Server real content, preferably dynamically
    -   Responsive layouts
    -   Responsive images
    -   Sprites
