## SEM - Search Engine Marketing

Search engine marketing is the practice of marketing a business using paid advertisements that appear on search engine results pages (or[SERPs](https://www.wordstream.com/serp)). Advertisers bid on keywords that users of services such as Google and Bing might enter when looking for certain products or services, which gives the advertiser the opportunity for their ads to appear alongside results for those search queries.

## Siphoning

In the context of SEO (Search Engine Optimization), Siphoning refers to the act of stealing another website's traffic. Methods for stealing that traffic can include wholesale copying of webpages (that have been slightly altered to redirect visitors elsewhere), using keywords and keyword phrases that "belong" to the targetted website, cybersquatting, etc.

In order to build a **site optimized for organic search engine rankings,** it is important to implement certain standards throughout the code. These include:
-   Specifying analttag on images
-   Using the correct HTML tags for content hierarchy i.e.,<h1>/<h2>/<h3>andp
-   Connect the site to the company's social pages
-   Add an XML sitemap
-   Avoid broken links
-   Use vanity/friendly URLs (human readable)
-   Add a robots.txt file
-   Integrate Google analytics (or alternative)
-   Specify a favicon, bonus for specifying browser specific icons
-   Ensure lightning fast page load time
-   Avoid JavaScript errors
-   Optimize assets (including minification)
-   Enable and force SSL
-   Specify unique titles for each page without exceeding 70 characters
-   Include a meta description on each page
-   Ensure there is enough content with enough relevant keywords (search engines will penalize your site if all pages are one-sentence pages)
-   Leverage browser caching
-   Avoid W3C markup validation errors
-   Specify relevant meta tags

## Optimize a website

Optimizing websites is an art that few are familiar with. The more the engineer is able to list off the top of their head, the more likely they are to do all of the following naturally as they code instead of having to return later.

(Also, typically a professionally constructed site should score over 75 percent when analyzed by[gtmetrix.com](https://gtmetrix.com/), which can also serve as a checklist.)
-   Optimize all assets
-   Place all assets on a separate, cookie-free domain. Using a CDN is best
-   Avoid inline JavaScript and CSS
-   Enable gzipping
-   Ensure all code is minified
-   Defer parsing of JavaScript
-   Usesrcsetfor responsive images
-   Leverage browser caching
-   Reduce DNS lookups
-   Avoid duplicate code
-   Avoid URL redirects
-   Enable HTTP keep-alive
-   Serve scaled images
-   Use image sprites where appropriate
-   Prefer asynchronous resources
-   Specify the character set at server level
-   Avoid CSS@import
-   Specify a cache validator
-   Minimize request size
-   Avoid bad requests and 404s
-   Specify image dimensions
-   Reduce cookie size
-   Make fewer HTTP requests, i.e., load as few external resources as possible
-   Avoid unnecessary images; where possible, use CSS
-   Ensure no validation errors with W3C

## Urchin Tracking Module(UTM)

Urchin Tracking Module(UTM)parametersare five variants of[URL parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string)used by marketers to track the effectiveness of online[marketing campaigns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_campaign)across traffic sources and publishing media. They were introduced by[Google Analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics)' predecessor[Urchin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urchin_(software))and, consequently, are supported[out-of-the-box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_the_box_(feature))by Google Analytics. The UTM parameters in a URL identify the campaign that refers traffic to a specific website,and attributes the browser's[website session](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#HTTP_session)and the sessions after that until the campaign attribution window expires to it. The parameters can be parsed by analytics tools and used to populate reports.Example URL, UTM parameters highlighted, after the question mark (?):
