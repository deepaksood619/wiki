**80/20 Rule / Pareto Principle**

In 1906 there was an Italian economist named Vilfredo Pareto. One day Pareto noticed that every year, 20% of the pea pods in his garden produced approximately 80% of the peas.



**The basic theory is that a limited number of actions create outsized results.**



This got him thinking about economic output on a larger scale. Sure enough, he began to find that in various industries, societies and even companies, 80% of the production often came from the 20% most productive faction.



**The 80/20 Principle states that 80% of the output or results will come from 20% of the input or action.**

-   About a fifth of your time is likely to give you 4/5ths of your achievement or results and 4/5th of your happiness -- Richard Koch



![Identify your 20% When you do a 20% activity, you get more energy out of it than you put into it. With this characteristic in mind, let's explore your past, present, and future for experiences that produce a net energy increase. Take out a blank piece of paper and create three columns with the headers "Past", Present", and "Future". In the "Past" column, write down anything that comes to mind when you think back to: Projects you're proud of. When you invest time and energy in hard but rewarding projects like the past projects you're proud of, you boost your overall sense of achievement and fulfillment. People you've learned the most from. Of all the podcasts I've listened to, roughly 80% of my insights have come from just two podcasts, The Tim Ferriss Show and The Huberman Lab. People you've enjoyed talking to. You may consider a friend from college who you could talk with for hours but have lost touch with. Putting in effort to renew that friendship and restart those great conversations will yield huge happiness returns. Enduring interests. I've loved reading personal development books and business books since I was a teenager, so I knew it was a safe place to invest my time and effort and to build a YouTube channel around that interest. Things you enjoyed more and were better at than you expected. If you enjoyed a public speaking course and were better than 80% of your class, giving more presentations at work could pay off in a big way. In the "Present" column, write down anything that comes to mind, when you think of: Work that sustains you. What tasks do you find hard to stop once you get started? What projects do you most look forward to working on again tomorrow? People you enjoy being around most. Who do you trust, respect, and have a lot in common with? Exercises you regularly do. What exercise makes you feel the best afterward? Food you regularly eat. Of all the foods you consume, which do you enjoy and makes you feel good afterward? In the "Future" column, write down anything that comes to mind when you think of: Events you're most looking forward to. This might include a game night with friends, a local competition for your favorite hobby, a conference, a sporting event, or time off work next month to work on a passion project. After each event, determine if it was better than you expected. Replicating better-than-expected events is a sure way to add 20% activities to your life. 40 20 Double your 20% Now that you have a list of 20% activities, double your time doing those activities to experience 160% of the happiness and success you experience today by stealing time away from 80% activities. An 80% activity yields less reward than the effort you put in. There are two categories of activity where you can find an abundance of 80% activities: ](media/Mental-Models-image1.jpg)
