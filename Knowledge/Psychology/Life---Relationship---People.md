When working with people, assume good intentions.

When listening to people, interpret their words in a generous way.

You will occasionally get burned and mistreated by always assuming the best in others, but it is a far better way to live than the opposite

Never tell people that they are moron



**Ernest Hemingway**

Before you talk, listen.

Before you react, think.

Before you spend, earn.

Before you criticise, wait.

Before you pray, forgive.

Before you quit, try.

**Relationship Quotes**

Marrying well makes everything easier.



It's okay to dislike someone, or even dislike someone for no reason. But it's not okay to disrespect, degrade, and humiliate that person



Find a partner who is ready to build with you.

It is not about finding perfection in another person, it is about realizing when you come across an undeniable connection that nourishes your being and matches the type of support you are looking for. Getting lost in the idea of perfection is a hindrance. Being with someone who is committed to going through the ups and downs of life together is truly priceless.

When two people embrace their imperfections and commit to growing into better versions of themselves, it will naturally enhance the happiness they share in the relationship.



Double down on your best relationship.

It's the investment with the highest return.



it's easier to destroy a relationship than build one.



The secret to feeling great about yourself is not to be found in searching for people who are less than you and then show yourself superior to them, but in searching for people who are more than you and then show yourself worthy of their company.

"A good marriage is one in which each spouse secretly thinks he or she got the better deal, and this is true also of our friendships."



What most people call love today is little more than a mutual benefit scheme. Love is an unconditional sweetness of emotion. -- Sadhguru



What you need to make your marriage successful is not the perfect person. What you need is absolute integrity. -- Sadhguru



The idea of marriage is to multiply the joy. Multiplying misery is a crime against Humanity. -- Sadhguru



If one spouse commutes longer than 45 minutes, that couple is 40% more likely to get divorced



There is really no such thing as conditional love and unconditional love -- there are conditions, and there is love. -- Sadhguru



Love is not a noun, but a verb. It's a thing you do.



Always give value before you ask for value.



Not taking things personally is a superpower.



EntrepreneurCindy Gallopon how to build a successful business:

"There is a formula for success in business, and it goes like this: You set out to find the very best talent in the marketplace, and then give them a compelling and inspirational vision of what you want them to achieve for you and the company. Then you empower them to achieve those goals using their own skills and talents in any way they choose. If, at the same time, you demonstrate how enormously you value them, not just through compensation, but also verbally, every single day, and if you enable that talent to share in the profit that they help create for you, you'll be successful. It's so simple, and virtually nobody does it, because it requires a high-trust working environment, and most business environments are low-trust. In order to own the future of your business, you have to design it around trust."



The less rigid your personality, the more powerful your presence. -- Sadhguru



Having expectations of others means you are trying to fix their lives. Fix your own life -- that is freedom. -- Sadhguru



Love is not about somebody. Love is not some kind of act. Love is the way you are.

**7 secrets to a healthy relationship**

1.  Appreciate your partner's efforts

If you want your relationship to work, constantly remind yourself that the other is more significant than you.

2.  Learn to respect personal space

3.  Express your emotions

4.  Discuss your concerns

5.  Trust your partner

6.  Share your passions

7.  Avoid blame game



**Gottman Ratio - 5 to 1 (can be used for habits also, for every one slip, do right 5/4 times)**

This means that for every one negative feeling or interaction between partners, there must be five positive feelings or interactions. Stable and happy couples share more positive feelings and actions than negative ones. Unhappy couples tend to have more negative feelings and actions than positive ones. Partners who criticize each other, provide constant negative feedback, aren't supportive of each other, don't demonstrate affection or appreciation, or behave uninterested in their partner are in relationships that are out of balance.



**The 5 love languages**

1.  Positive, uplifting words of affirmation

    a.  Praise is the sweetest of all sounds

    b.  Verbal compliments

        i.  appreciate their sense of humor

        ii. look great in a new outfit

        iii. praise their ability to care for your children

2.  Spend quality time with your partner

3.  Gifts are visual symbols of love and surprising your partner with regular presents, regardless of their monteary value, is a great way to show affection

4.  Doing useful things for your partner is a common way to express love

5.  Physical touch is a powerful way to show your love

6.  Greatest gift - Helping your partner through hard times (simply standing by your partner during rough periods)



**How to be an adult in relationships by David Richo**
-   The emotional support we seek when we're young can be broken down into what the author callsthe five A's. They are attention, acceptance, appreciation, affection, and allowing others to be who they are.
    -   First up,attention. In relationships, being attentive to our partners means listening to their thoughts and emotions. Often, this involves being what the author calls a "mindful witness." Our loved ones may have suffered abuse, betrayals, or hurts in the past and, as their partners, it's our job to listen to their stories respectfully.
    -   Second, there isacceptance-- of ourselves and others. Mutual acceptance is the bedrock of a healthy relationship. When we find someone who loves us -- with all our feelings and emotional burdens -- we feel liberated. We don't have to hide behind a mask because our partner loves us for all that we are.
    -   The third thing isappreciation.This involves valuing our partners' gifts, knowing and understanding their limitations, and supporting them in the pursuit of their dreams and desires.
    -   Affection is the fourthAon the list. It involves holding and touching our partners in respectful ways. Receiving affection in the form of kisses, hugs, or even a gentle smile across a room helps us feel loved and wanted. It meets our childlike need to feel safe and secure.
    -   The fifth and finalAisallowinglife and love to be just what they are -- with all their sorrow, ecstasy, and heartache -- without trying to take control. This is what it takes to bepresentin a relationship: to love and to be loved.
-   Working through our issues involves paying attention and letting go.
-   mindfulness -- an ancient Buddhist practice that brings our attention to what is happening in the present. Through mindfulness techniques, clients learn to notice the thoughts or feelings that arise within them -- but, instead of holding on to them, they learn to let them go.
-   To begin, sit in a quiet space with your eyes open or closed, your back straight, and your hands placed in your lap. Pay attention to your breath. When thoughts or anxieties enter your mind, notice them, label them as "thoughts," and then return to your breathing. Of course, this takes practice. Eventually, your breath will drown out any distracting thoughts in the back of your mind.
-   **This is how we can think of relationships, too: they start out with romance, they progress into conflict, and then repose in commitment. And these cycles can repeat themselves again and again.**
    -   Romance > Conflict > Compromise
    -   In a committed relationship, couples are able to give and receive thefive A's. They let go of their desire to be right in arguments, and instead search for compromise. They may still fight, but they do not stop loving each other.
    -   "The rose of relationship grows petals in romance, thorns in conflict, and roots in commitment."
-   Admit,Allow, andAct As If.
    -   First, you have to admit your fears to yourself and others. This involves naming your fears without blaming anyone. For example, you could say to your partner,"I am scared to get close to you because . . . ," or"my fear of betrayal comes from . . . ."
    -   Then, you have to allowyourself to feel your fears, without judging them. This aligns with our practice of mindfulness: we allow our feelings to emerge, we recognize them for what they are, and then we let them go.
    -   Next up, act as if you have no fear. For example, if you fear abandonment, try to get comfortable being away from your partner for one minute more each day. And, if you fear engulfment, try to stay away from your partner for one minute less.
-   Loving one person teaches us how to love the rest of the world.

**Party / Host / Hosting / Ceremony / Anchor / Commentator**

MC is short for **Master of Ceremonies** and may often be written as **emcee**. An MC can be an important part of a birthday party, acting as a host to allow the birthday boy or girl to enjoy the party along with guests. Although the party atmosphere will provide a good time, the MC ideally remains focused on the multifaceted responsibilities the job demands.
-   Annoucements
-   Music selection
-   Setting the tone
-   Setting the place

<https://www.ehow.com/info_8201232_duties-emcee.html>

1.  **Arrive to the party venue well before the guests** so you can become familiar with the sound system and test the microphone. Showing up early will also allow you to see how the party site is set up, so you know where to make eye contact to keep the audience engaged.

2.  **Look at the program for your manager's farewell party**. As the MC, you'll need to know how to introduce each speaker that will present an award or kind word to the **guest of honor.** If you have a small speech prepared, becoming familiar with the program will give you an idea of when you should present it. If necessary, jot down a few notes on the program that will help you with guest introductions, such as "worked with guest of honor the longest" or "closest professional friend."

3.  Take your place on the stage or podium before guests arrive so you can welcome all the party goers.

4.  **State the reason for the gathering,** and lead the guests in showing your manager a round of applause as she's ushered into the room or seated at the main table.

5.  **Introduce each individual** before he gets up to share a short speech or poem at the celebration, using your notes as guidelines. Encourage the crowd to give every presenter a round of applause as he walks to the front of the room.

6.  **Conclude the speaking portion** of the farewell party by sharing a fond memory you have of your manager, and calling her up to the front so you can present her with a gift from you and the rest of your colleagues, like a plaque or large bouquet of flowers.

7.  **Thank everyone for coming** to the farewell celebration and prompt everyone to continue socializing or dining or cordially dismiss them from the party venue, depending on how the program is scheduled.

-   Checklist



**Boundaries**

You have a boundary issue if...
-   you feel like people take advantage of you or use your emotions for their own gain.
-   you feel like you're constantly having to "save" people close to you and fix their problems all the time.
-   you find yourself sucked into pointless fighting or debating regularly.
-   you find yourself more invested in a person than you should.
-   you tell people how much you hate drama but seem to always be stuck in the middle of it.
-   you spend a lot of time defending yourself for things you believe aren't your fault

**The Courage to be Happy by Ichiro Kishimi**
-   The purpose of education is to teach self-reliance
-   Respect is seeing another person for who they are
    -   Give children respect, so they respect you
-   Don't scold problem behavior... but don't praise good behavior, either
    -   Don't praise children for good behavior
        -   They need to do that behavior
    -   Don't scold them for bad behavior which they don't know is bad
    -   Children are attention seeking, so they will do same things again and again to get attention
        -   Ex - Manuj throws tantrum so he get the family's attention, Family gives attention to him and it's a vicious cycle
-   Praise inhibits growth and encourages unhealthy competition
    -   Giving praise says, "I respect you when you act in one way, but not in other ways."
    -   In marathon, surrounded by other runners, you feel no rivalry towards others. That's what competition without rivalry looks like
-   Your friendship is the most powerful lesson you can give your students
-   Birth order influences children's behavior... and adults' too
    -   equal relationships with each children
-   Love supports the transition from dependence to self-reliance
-   Actionable advice: Don't dole out praise, cultivate empathy
    -   Don't say, "You are kind for sharing", instead say,
    -   When you shared your toy with Neha, you made her feel very happy



Trust does not mean that others have to do things the way you expect them to. Trust means to become vulnerable.



Trust involves vulnerability, which involves risk. So **Dispositional Trust,** is tied to an idea called **Risk Aversion**, or how much you avoid risks.



"Friends are better than money. Almost anything money can do, friends can do better. In so many ways a friend with a boat is better than owning a boat."

Transcendental Meditation(TM) refers to a specific form of silent,[mantra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantra)[meditation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation)and to the organizations that constitute the[Transcendental Meditation movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_Meditation_movement).[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharishi_Mahesh_Yogi)created and introduced the TM technique and TM movement in[India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India)in the mid-1950s.



The TM technique involves the use of a silently-used sound called a mantra, and is practiced for 15--20 minutes twice per day. It is taught by certified teachers through a standard course of instruction, which costs a fee that varies by country. According to the Transcendental Meditation movement, it is a non-religious method for relaxation,[stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology))reduction, and self-development. The technique has been seen as both religiousand non-religious;[sociologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociologist), scholars, and a[New Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey)judge and court are among those who have expressed views on it being religious or non-religious.The United States Court of Appeals upheld the federal ruling that TM was essentially "religious in nature" and therefore could not be taught in public schools.



High-quality studies that demonstrate positive health outcomes that can be attributed to the specific practice of TM as compared to other forms of stress reduction do not exist.

**Implicit Association Test (IAT)**

The**implicit-association test(IAT)** is a[measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement)within[social psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology)designed to detect the strength of a person's subconscious association between mental representations of objects ([concepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept)) in [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory). It is commonly applied to assess[implicit stereotypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_stereotype)held by test subjects, such as unconsciously associating stereotypically black names with words consistent with black stereotypes. The test's format is highly versatile, and has been used to investigate biases in racial groups, gender, sexuality, age, and religion, as well as assessing self-esteem.



The IAT was introduced in the scientific literature in 1998 by[Anthony Greenwald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Greenwald), Debbie McGhee, and Jordan Schwartz.The IAT is now widely used in social psychology research and, to some extent, in[clinical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology),[cognitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_psychology), and[developmental psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology)research. The IAT is the subject of much controversy regarding validity, reliability, and whether test results are an accurate representation of[implicit bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_bias).

**Blinkist - Life Is in the Transitions, Mastering Change at Any Age By Bruce Feiler**
-   What shape has your life story taken?
-   Lifequakes shake the foundations of our existence.
-   Disruptorsaffect every area of our lives
-   Lifequakes force us to reevaluate what makes our lives meaningful.
-   Lifequakes are by their nature disorientating, and even scary. But they also present opportunities to reevaluate our lives and what makes them meaningful.
-   We can't always control disruptive events, but we do control our response to them.
    -   ABC stands for autonomy, belonging, and cause
-   Rituals help us to say goodbye to the lives we're leaving behind.
    -   We can turn destructive events into meaningful transitions, but this requires practice. Luckily, several key tools can help us become masters at dealing with transitions.
    -   The first tool we need to master is acceptance
    -   A very normal reaction to experiencing a lifequake is denial and resistance.
    -   Acceptance can strike in a sudden epiphany, or a series of slow realizations.
-   All major transitions involve a messy middle, where we feel very lost.
-   Our creativity can help us to create a new chapter in a transition.
    -   Every major religious narrative and fairy tale recognizes the value of being lost. Jesus was cast into the desert before he had a major epiphany, and Mohamed gained his wisdom on a mountaintop. The most formative experience of Red Riding Hood's life would never have been possible if she hadn't wandered into that forest.
-   We need to create new life stories that integrate our transitions.
-   Actionable advice: Pay attention to small wins.

**Find Your Element by Ken Robinson**
-   Expose yourself to as many new opportunities as possible to discover your unrealized aptitudes.
-   Strive to have a growth mindset. It will allow you to develop and improve your abilities.
-   Find your passions, things you do without noticing the passage of time.
-   Forge your own path, along with an understanding of your happiness, instead of blindly seeking wealth, immediate gratification, or other people's definitions of happiness.
-   Don't plan your life when you're young because life is unpredictable.
-   Don't assume you are bad at something because you performed poorly in that subject in school. Standardized tests only measure one kind of human intelligence and schools only cater to a few learning styles.
-   Every person is special and different because of their genetic makeup (every human who ever existed in history has their own genes) and their environment (everyone has their unique mix of family, friends, and location).
-   If you accept you can't predict or control the future, you will discover many new opportunities.
-   Experiencing positive emotions from your passion reduces stress, chronic pain, and addictions. It also improves sleep and concentration.
-   Finding a group of people who share your passion can be very beneficial, or even necessary, for both you and other members of the group to realize personal goals.

**Blinkist - Solve for Happy - Engineer your path to joy by Mo Gawdat (26 June 2018)**
-   Happiness is the absence of unhappiness, caused by the misrepresentation and misunderstanding of reality
    -   Your happiness is equal to or greater than your perception of events minus your expectations of life
-   You are not the voice in your head, but the observer of your life
-   It's important to understand that you really know nothing, and that time is, in fact, a human invention
-   You don't actually have much control over your life, and your fears are often unfounded
-   Our brains tend to see the negative side of things, applying too many filters, assumptions and predictions
-   We tend to elaborate our memories, apply too many labels, succumb to our emotions and exaggerate things
-   Modern life is overly concerned with action and speed, but a calm awareness of the present moment will keep you happy
-   Things are and always will be changing, so relinquish your sense of control and go with the flow
-   Unconditional love is the most important emotion, as it has no expctations, and therefore no disappointments
-   Death is a fundamental part of existence. Acceptance rather than fear will allow you to properly embrace life
-   In the absence of proof and the surprisingly overwhelming odds, perhaps there is a design to the Universe

**Blinkist - Essentialism by Greg McKeown**
-   How to do better by doing less
-   We should be focusing on what we should do, thinking instead about what is essential to our happiness and well-being
-   4 main points
    -   Do less, but do it better
    -   Reject the notion that we should accomplish everything
    -   Constantly question yourself and update plans accordingly
    -   Changes are put in place
-   **Learned helplessness,** that is, becoming so used to the feeling of being overwhelmed that we approach our lives with passivity. (Dogs with electric shock and a lever with no effect choose to stay in shock zone, because they have learned helplessness)
    -   Opposite - [learned industriousness](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/11/02/motivation/#07-05)
-   Take a few hours of blank time for thinking about yourself and always see the bigger picture on why you are doing what you do
-   Sleep and play are as important as work
-   Be ruthless in cutting away things that aren't essential
-   Say "no" to nonessential tasks and plan the essential ones carefully (How will i know when i have reached my goal)
-   Stop doing unncessary things by withdrawing from failure and setting boundaries (Admit errors and mistakes and let go)
-   Keeping on top of what's important requires that you eliminate what slows you down and elminate it.
-   Always take 50% of buffer time that you have expected a work to take
-   Building upon previous progress with small, incremental steps. Small wins create momentum, which gives you the confidence to further succeed.
-   Routine is very important to achieve long term goals

**Blinkist - How to live a good life by Massimo pigliucci**

**A guide to choosing your personal philosohy**
-   The ancient Eastern philosophy of Buddhism values ethics above all.
-   Confucianism is about relationships, while Daoism teaches us to act in harmony with the world
    -   Fundamental toConfucianism, according to the scholar Bryan Van Norden, is the fact that we cannot exist independently of others. After all, our parents are the only reason we exist. So, in order to live well, we must maintain our relationships.
    -   Daoismshares Confucianism's sense of interconnectedness, but it places emphasis onnature. It embraces things on their own terms and never lets emotions cloud thoughts. Some people think that Daoism is just about being with nature, but there's more to it than that. Our relationship with nature can represent the challenges we face in life.
    -   A contemporary example of a Daoist mindset is what Professor Robin R. Wang calls the "Realtor's mentality." A realtor might work for 30 clients at once knowing that only a couple will buy from him. Rather than getting frustrated by the low success rate, the realtor learns not to fixate on any one client and calmly accepts the reality of that situation.
-   Aristotelianism encourages us to flourish -- but acknowledges that external factors also play their part.
    -   AnAristotelianis someone who follows Aristotle's teachings from his famous work,Nicomachean Ethics.
    -   Think of a very talented tennis player -- someone who is good enough to count as one of the all-time greats. If she lives during a period when the competition is weak, she will never be able to prove her talent. That player simply won't have an opportunity to flourish.
    -   Unfortunately, we're not all equally capable of this -- just like that talented tennis player. Think of someone born into an unsupportive family, or someone whose life is ruined by a natural disaster. It's harder for these people to flourishthrough no fault of their own.
-   Stoicism focuses on indifference, while Epicureanism focuses on pleasure.
    -   ataraxia-- a state of tranquility -- so she will be able to cope calmly with misfortune.
    -   Stoics divide things outside their control into two categories:preferredanddispreferred indifferents. Think about wealth. Being rich is always going to be preferred, while being poor is dispreferred. But Stoicism says that your level of wealth doesn't affect how virtuous you are. A rich person may be either good or bad. So, wealth is "indifferent" and doesn't affect whether you're a good person.
    -   A Stoic's focus on indifference can also help with negative emotions. Say someone insults you. Rather than getting angry, think about the criticism. Is there any truth in it? If so, the insulter has done you a favor. If not,who cares? The person is wrong. Not that we should be emotionless. Stoicism does allow for positive emotions like joy and love.
    -   Epicureanismplaces more emphasis on feeling. In fact, it's based around the simple concept ofpleasure.
        -   We all naturally strive for pleasure. Even babies avoid pain and seek pleasure -- it's what philosopher and author Hiram Crespo calls thepleasure-aversion faculty. That doesn't mean unbridled hedonism, though -- not if we practicehedonic calculus. Hedonic calculus involves weighing whether something is likely to prove pleasurable in the longer term.
        -   So an epicure wouldn't simply drink all the beer in one evening. He would recognize that, after a certain number of beers, the overall experience -- hangover included -- wouldn't be pleasurable. Conversely, some major decisions like studying at a university might be painful at first, but pleasurable in the long run.
-   Hinduism and Progressive Islam both bring ancient ideas into a modern context.
    -   Progressive Islam rejects extremism, champions social and gender justice, and embraces the multiple faiths that make up the modern world.
-   "Ethical values like justice and fairness do not remain frozen in time." -- Adis Duderija
-   In both Judaism and Christianity, scripture provides an opportunity for reflection.
-   Ethical Culture and secular humanism are two philosophies that don't involve belief in God.
    -   Ethical Culture, which defines itself as a nontheistic religion. As its name suggests, it places a strong emphasis on ethics and the value of community. It emphasizes the importance of these traditional values by having a clergy, like many theistic religions.
    -   Secular humanism, on the other hand, is not a religion. It's a non-dogmatic philosophy that stresses the importance of independent thinking.
    -   Guided by reason, secular humanism offers a practical way to understand and improve the human condition. The emphasis on reason means that secular humanism respects science deeply.
-   Existentialism and pragmatism both reflect on the ways in which we are free.
    -   Did you choose to be born? No? Neither did anyone else.
    -   That's the starting point for existentialism, the twentieth-century philosophy of Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. Having been born, we are conscious and free to make our own choices. Hence, in Sartre's words, we are "condemned to be free."
    -   There's something contradictory about existentialism, as Skye C. Cleary acknowledges. Actually callingyourself an existentialist contradicts what it's really about. We shouldn't let ourselves be defined by any particular set of beliefs; instead, we should simply be authentic to ourselves. And as individuals, we're too complex to be summed up by a simple label anyway -- especially since we're all constantly changing.
    -   Sartre gave the example of a waiter who's good at his job. He comes to believe that being a waiter is what defines him. But no single role caneverdefine a person. We must acknowledge that things will change in the future, just like they did in the past.
-   Effective altruism is just one way we're still exploring philosophical questions today.
    -   Effective altruismtakes a simple approach. It asks its followers to examine how they canmaximizetheir positive impact on the world. In many cases, this is through donating as much as possible to charity. Or it might be through taking on jobs that do exceptional amounts of good.



**Blinkist - The Almanack of Naval Ravikant**
-   **A philosopher is someone who falls down a well while gazing up at the stars**
-   If you're unsure about a decision, then the answer is no
-   A good reputation is an invaluable asset
-   If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you
    -   Money can't buy happiness or make all your problems disappear, but it will solve your money problems.
    -   Zero-sum game have its uses. Take Politics. If we didn't play it, we wouldn't be able to tell who was in charge of things. Fundamentally, though, it's no more than a necessary evil. That's why you should seek to avoid it in your life. Play it too often and you'll become an angry, combative, and resentful person dedicated to putting others down
    -   The money game is different. It's not zero-sum, it's **positive-sum**. You can win without someone else losing, or become wealthy without condemning someone else to poverty.
-   Money can give you freedom - unless you love it for its own sake
    -   Money fixes a lot of external problems. It removes obstacles that stop you from doing the things you really want to do.
    -   It you love money, there's never enough - it's a **bottomless pit**
-   Happiness is a choice to remain in the present moment
    -   Happiness is understood as the absence of judgements, which is associated with the absence of desire. The **fewer desires** you have, the greater your ability to accept the way things are right now. This brings inner calm.
    -   The more you **live in the present**, the happier you'll be
    -   Think of young children. On balance, they're pretty happy. Why? Easy! They're immersed in the moment rather than caught up in their own heads.
-   A quiet mind is a happy mind
    -   To sit **still** for 30 minutes is happiness. The reason this is so hard to achieve is that we're distracted by our desires
    -   Happiness we think, is "**out there**" in the external world
    -   **Monkey Mind -** Thoughts, the Buddha said, are like branches, and the conscious mind is like a monkey swinging from one branch to the next
    -   The answer to this problem is to train the monkey. Meditation - quieting the simian chatter that prevents us from being present
    -   Meditation comes in different forms. Hiking is Walking meditation, Journaling is Writing meditation, prayer is gratitude meditation. Even showering can be a kind of accidental meditation
-   Discovering what calms your mind and building good habits are keys to happiness
    -   Happiness isn't innate - it's a skill
    -   Try different things and find out what works for you
    -   If it works, use it; if it doesn't, look for something else
    -   Cutting down on alcohol, caffeine and sugar will keep your mood more stable. So will avoiding social media
    -   Regular exercise is a good habit for both your body and your mind
-   Actionable advice - Lean into short-term pain (ex - working out)

**From Strength to Strength: Finding Success, Happiness and Deep Purpose in the Second Half of Life**

Of the 125 people in Marcellus, half a dozen or so people are over 40. After we read Arthur Brooks' book 'From Strength to Strength' (thanks to a gift from a client who has also become a friend), we understood why those of us over 40 contribute the majority of the pieces to Three Longs and Three Shorts. As Brooks explains in this tightly written book, for people like us in the Finance profession, the raw intellectual horsepower or our brain (which is called 'fluid intelligence') starts waning from the age of 40. Thankfully, however, a different type of intelligence starts improving from that age, namely, 'crystallised intelligence' i.e. the ability to absorb lots of different bits of information and influences and join the dots. Brooks uses this framework to give professionals in their 40s and 50s a framework for the second half of their careers.



As Jonathan Knee says in his review of this book:"According to From Strength to Strength...the basic problem is the inevitable decline in our abilities. The decline in peak performance begins far earlier than we are likely to admit across professions, not just in athletes. According to Brooks, "on average, the peak of creative careers occurs at about 20 years after career inception," so that professional decay is likely to commence between ages 35 and 50. Financial professionals peak between 36 and 40.



Like drug addiction, each subsequent hit of success yields a shorter period of satisfaction, necessitating greater feats of performance just as the capacity to produce them declines with age.



Strength to Strength reads like a companion volume to the cult classic from 1979, The Drama of the Gifted Child by Swiss psychoanalyst Alice Miller. Miller pointed out that talented children can become addicted to the positive feedback that their talents inspire, and may never develop an identity independent of the expectations of others."



So what is the solution to the mid-40s fade? How can those of us who are in the second half of our careers capitalise on our crystalised intelligence? Brooks' answer is that we should turn to teaching, writing and mentoring rather than trying to compete with younger people who are at their peak in terms of fluid intelligence.



However, this is not as easy as it sounds. Whilst several of us 40 plusers in Marcellus are writing, teaching and mentoring, we will be the first to admit that old habits are hard to shake off. Says Jim Clemmer:"Arthur devotes a chapter to "Kick Your Success Addiction" with powerful examples, research, and advice on dealing with workaholism and getting off the hedonic treadmill. "The buzz from success is neutralized quickly, leaving a hangover feeling.... after a while, you need constant success hits just not to feel like a failure...the carrot is gradually getting further away, despite the fact that you are running faster than ever. Thus, the dissatisfaction problem compounds the decline problem."



Arthur provides several steps to transitioning from fluid intelligence to the second curve of crystallized intelligence. This includes pondering our death --- what do we want our life to stand for, cultivating (real versus "deal") relationships, deepening our spirituality, making the weakness of our decline a strength to connecting with others, and filling the second half of our lives with opportunities rather than loss. He concludes with a chapter on Seven Words to Remember; "Use things. Love people. Worship the divine.""



Interestingly, Buddhist and Hindu philosophy plays a key role in the prescriptions that Arthur Brooks dispenses in this timely book (timely for those of us who are battling with the decline of our fluid intelligence and the rise of our crystallised intelligence).



**Thoughts about people**

Almost everyone in this world is idiot and have nothing to contribute, but never say this to them... Always say them okay and ignore instead of demeaning him/her, because they cannot handle it



Don't say bad to people whom you don't give money, only if they are dependent on you, and they are fearful you can say something



Otherwise show disappointment
