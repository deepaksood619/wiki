-   Planning Fallacy
-   Sunk Cost & Status Quo Bias



**Plans are worthless, Planning is everything**



**Meetings**
-   Pre-meeting notes - prepare for the meeting along with agenda
-   Post-meeting
    -   Send the final notes of what to do, when to do, who will do that
    -   Share the next calendar invite for the next followup
-   No presentation reading in meetings (share presentation before the meeting, or after)



**Meeting Agenda (goal-oriented)**

1.  What are you trying to achieve?

2.  Why is it important?

3.  Who do you need onboard to hit your target?

4.  How much time will it take?

**Skip-level meetings**

A skip-level meeting is a one-on-one meeting where upper managers meet directly with employees, bypassing the employee's direct manager, essentially "skipping" a level of management to connect directly with employees.



The goal of a skip-level meeting is twofold:
-   For employeesto gain insight into company goals, objectives, and strategies.
-   For senior leadersto create a shared space for employees to discuss career progression, professional goals and give feedback.

**Meetings**
-   Get everyone in on the action

Proactively give less dominant participants the floor by calling on them individually.On remote calls, regularly check if remote participants are able to follow the conversation and contribute.


-   Interrupt interruptions

Lead by example and call out when you see someone being inadvertently silenced in a discussion. Encourage others to do the same. Come equipped with phrases like, "Hang on a sec, Fatima -- I want to make sure I understand Aniket's point before we add on to it."



If anyone is a repeat offender, take them aside for a moment after the meeting and point it out to them. Assume they're totally oblivious to their behaviors -- peoplerarelyact this way on purpose.


-   Give credit where credit's due

When someone makes a good point, acknowledge their contribution and give public attribution to their ideas. Don't let hijackers get away with appropriation, and highlight when value has been added.


-   Use the power of the pen

If one person is dominating, ask them to be the scribe. This intrinsically tasks them with listening and creates a space for others.


-   Write and share

Give everyone time to process the question, jot down thoughts on paper, and share what they've come up with. This gives less vocal participants time to gather their thoughts and ensures they'll be heard.


-   Clean up as you go

At the end of each agenda topic,pause to agree on next steps and establish specific commitments with clear deadlines. Assign Directly Responsible Individuals (DRI) and rotate the DRI role to ensure the loudest person doesn't receive all of the action items.


-   Follow-ups

Circulate a follow-up note that captures the key takeaways, action items, and DRIs.This way everyone is in the loop and on the same page (consider that remote participants may not have been able to hear everything perfectly).



Proactively solicit ideas that might've come to mind after the meeting. To produce their best work,introverts need time alone to process new information. For example, send out a message along the lines of:"Anyone have a new insight about this situation since we met? If so, I'd love to hear it."



Keep tabs on action items.Assign someone to check in at appropriate intervals after the meeting to ensurethe commitments are being kept, or re-evaluated if something unexpected came up.

**Checklist**

![LIST: Create/Update a Backlog List (list document) Quickly list or update ALL desirable outcomes for the project. Format these outcomes to represent specific points in the 'User's Experience Story': Who (X) + What (Y) + Why (Z) - "As an operator (X), I use the touch screen to start the motor (Y), so I can control the pump remotely (Z)." Ensure each item is testable (can be built and tested according to a clear set of pass-fail requirements). Sort items in order of their ability to validate critical assumptions AND provide immediate value. ESTIMATE: Part 1: Refine and Estimate Backlog Items (list document with numbers and sections boxed off) 1. Assign the longest duration item(s) with a 13 (highest Fibonacci number in the sequence: 1,2,3,5,8,13) 2. Assign Fibonacci numbers 1,2,3,5,8,13 to all items, relative to the hardest item Part 2: Sprint Planning Session Set fixed Sprint duration (time till next evaluation - max 20% of the project duration) INITIAL SPRINT: estimate points to be completed within that time 2. SUCCESSIVE SPRINTS: previous Sprint actual point total + 10% 3. POPULATE: Make Work Next Actions Visible CHART: Write all items that need to be completed during the current Sprint onto cards and put them in the 'DO' column of your Scrum Board (a Scrum board is a wall board with post-it notes OR software program with 3 lists: DO, DOING, DONE --- I suggest using the software program Trello.com). Move the three top priority items into the 'DOING' column (never have more than 3 items in the DOING column). When you complete an item move it from the 'DOING' column to the 'DONE' column. Make Work Progress Visible At the end of each day, take the total number of points in the 'DONE' list and subtract that that total from the Sprint total. Show the results on a 'Burndown Chart' (a line chart that reduces in value each day, with the y-axis representing the Sprint point total and the x-axis representing the number of day in the Sprint): ASK: Conduct 15-minute Daily Stand-up Meetings • What did l/we do yesterday to help the team finish the Sprint? • What can l/we do today to help the team finish the Sprint? • What upcoming obstacles might slow my/our progress? DEMONSTRATE: Host a Sprint Demonstration Invite all project stakeholders (client, management, product owner or potential customer). Show the Sprint results (functional products only). Gather constructive feedback. REFLECT: Conduct a Sprint Retrospective (lessons learned document) What went well? What could have been better? What can we do differently next Sprint? ](media/Project-Management_Scrum---Meetings-image6.jpg)

**Souding Board Meeting**

<https://smallbusiness.chron.com/adobe-creative-cloud-grow-business-13771091.html>

Sounding board meetings are typically group forums designed to elicit opinions about a particular matter. Some small business owners use these types of meetings to troubleshoot new product or marketing ideas, while others use them as problem-resolution platforms. Sounding board meetings can be very advantageous, as they can help a small business owner discover breakthrough ideas or solutions to ongoing problems, as well as move forward on new projects quickly. If you are planning to launch a new product or service, or you simply want to clear up misunderstandings that are plaguing the office, plan an effective, efficient sounding board meeting.
