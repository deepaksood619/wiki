**Celiac Disease** - <https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/38085.php>

Celiac disease is a chronic digestive disorder resulting from an immune reaction to gliadin, a gluten protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and sometimes oats.



[Celiac disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celiac_disease)(CD) is a chronic, multiple-organ[autoimmune disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_disorder)primarily affecting the[small intestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine)caused by the ingestion of wheat, barley, rye, oats, and derivatives, that appears in[genetically predisposed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_predisposition)people of all ages.CD is not only a gastrointestinal disease, because it may involve several organs and cause an extensive variety of non-gastrointestinal symptoms, and most importantly, it may be apparently asymptomatic.Many asymptomatic people actually are not, but have become accustomed to living with a chronic bad health status as if it were normal, and they are able to recognize that they actually had symptoms related to celiac disease after starting the gluten-free diet and improvement is evident, in contrast to the situation prior to the diet.Added difficulties for diagnosis are the fact that serological markers ([anti-tissue transglutaminase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-transglutaminase_antibodies#Anti-tissue_transglutaminase)[TG2]) are not always present and many people may have minor mucosal lesions, without atrophy of the[intestinal villi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_villi).



CD affects approximately 1--2% of the general population,but most cases remain unrecognized, undiagnosed and untreated, and at risk for serious long-term health complications.People may suffer severe disease symptoms and be subjected to extensive investigations for many years, before a proper diagnosis is achieved.Untreated CD may cause[malabsorption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malabsorption), reduced quality of life,[iron deficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_deficiency), [osteoporosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis), an increased risk of intestinal[lymphomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma), and greater mortality. CD is associated with some other autoimmune diseases, such as[diabetes mellitus type 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1),[thyroiditis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroiditis),[gluten ataxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ataxia), [psoriasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriasis), [vitiligo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitiligo),[autoimmune hepatitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_hepatitis),[dermatitis herpetiformis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis_herpetiformis), [primary sclerosing cholangitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_sclerosing_cholangitis), and more.



CD with "classic symptoms", which include gastrointestinal manifestations such as chronic diarrhea and abdominal distention, malabsorption, loss of appetite, and impaired growth, is currently the least common presentation form of the disease and affects predominantly small children generally younger than two years of age.



CD with "non-classic symptoms" is the most common clinical typeand occurs in older children (over 2 years old),adolescents, and adults.It is characterized by milder or even absent gastrointestinal symptoms and a wide spectrum of non-intestinal manifestations that can involve any organ of the body, and very frequently may be completely asymptomaticboth in children (at least in 43% of the cases) and adults.

**Non-celiac gluten sensitivity**

Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is described as a condition of multiple symptoms that improves when switching to a[gluten-free diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten-free_diet), after celiac disease and wheat allergy are excluded. Recognized since 2010,it is included among[gluten-related disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten-related_disorders).Its[pathogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogenesis)is not yet well understood, but the activation of the innate immune system, the direct negative effects of gluten and probably other wheat components, are implicated.



NCGS is the most common syndrome of[gluten intolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten_intolerance),[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten#cite_note-CatassiBai-58)[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten#cite_note-CzajaBulsa-60)with a prevalence estimated to be 6-10%.NCGS is becoming a more common diagnosis, but its true prevalence is difficult to determine because many people self-diagnose and start a gluten-free diet, without having previously tested for celiac disease or having the dietary prescription from a physician.People with NCGS and gastrointestinal symptoms remain habitually in a "no man's land", without being recognized by the specialists and lacking the adequate medical care and treatment.Most of these people have a long history of health complaints and unsuccessful consultations with numerous physicians, trying to get a diagnosis of celiac disease, but they are only labeled as[irritable bowel syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome).A consistent although undefined number of people eliminate gluten because they identify it as responsible for their symptoms and these improve with the[gluten-free diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten-free_diet), so they self-diagnose as NCGS.



People with NCGS may develop gastrointestinal symptoms, which resemble those of[irritable bowel syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome)or[wheat allergy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_allergy),or a wide variety of non-gastrointestinal symptoms, such as[headache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache), chronic[fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)),[fibromyalgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibromyalgia),[atopic diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy),[allergies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy),[neurological diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder), or[psychiatric disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder), among others.The results of a 2017 study suggest that NCGS may be a chronic disorder, as is the case with celiac disease.



Besides gluten, additional components present in wheat, rye, barley, oats, and their derivatives, including other proteins called amylase-trypsin inhibitors (ATIs) and short-chain[carbohydrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrates) known as[FODMAPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FODMAP), may cause NCGS symptoms. As of 2019, reviews conclude that although FODMAPs present in wheat and related grains may play a role in non-celiac gluten sensitivity, they only explain certain gastrointestinal symptoms, such as[bloating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloating), but not the[extra-digestive symptoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-celiac_gluten_sensitivity#Extraintestinal)that people with non-celiac gluten sensitivity may develop, such as[neurological disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder),[fibromyalgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibromyalgia), psychological disturbances, and[dermatitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis).ATIs may cause toll-like receptor 4 ([TLR4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLR4))-mediated intestinal[inflammation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation)in humans.

**Lactose Intolerance**

People with lactose intolerance cannot metabolize lactose properly, because their digestive system produces too little of an enzyme known as lactase. If they consume foods containing lactose, they may experience bloating, flatulence, and diarrhea.

**Hyperthyroidism**

Hyperthyroidism, or overactive thyroid, happens when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone. This has an impact throughout the body.

Non productive cough / Dry cough



Viral infection

When you get infected with one of the many viruses that cause the common cold, your short-term symptoms usually last less than a week. It's not uncommon, however, for a cough to linger long after your other symptoms have improved.



These post-cold coughs are usually dry and can last for up to two months. They're usually the result of irritation in your airway, which is often overly sensitive after a viral illness.



This type of cough is difficult to treat and often requires time and patience. Coughing only increases the irritation in your airway, so try using throat lozenges and warm liquids to soothe your throat. This may help to reduce your coughing, giving your airway a chance to heal.



sucking on throat lozenges to moisturize and soothe irritated throat tissue

taking OTC cough suppressants, such as dextromethorphan (Robitussin), to suppress your cough reflex

adding honey to a hot drink to soothe irritated throat tissue



**Thalassaemia**

any of a group of hereditary haemolytic diseases caused by faulty haemoglobin synthesis, widespread in Mediterranean, African, and Asian countries.



Thalassemiais a blood disorder passed down through families (inherited) in which the body makes an abnormal form or inadequate amount of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen.



It can be prevented in babies before birth



**Tests**

(Some studies have found that regular annual check-ups do not bring clear health benefits to the population as a whole, but doctors still recommend them, especially for those over 50.) Every five years. At least every two years if you have normal blood pressure; at least once per year if it is elevated or if you are at increased risk for heart disease and stroke (such as from smoking or diabetes). Get this checked regularly; discuss with clinician, as professional recommendations vary about how often. Discuss with clinician if you are at increased risk because of previous bone fractures or other factors (see "Osteoporosis," page 38); not recommended for other men. Discuss with clinician if you have risk factors for diabetes (see page 1 4), if your blood pressure is higher than 135/80, or if you use medication to control your blood pressure. Once a year, during a regular physical exam. Discuss with clinician. Both partners should be tested for STIs and HIV before initiating intercourse. Discuss with clinician. Before age 75, use one of these three methods: (1) fecal occult blood test annually; (2) flexible sigmoidoscopy every five years; (3) colonoscopy every 10 years. After age 75, discuss with clinician. Until age 54, every two to four years; from 55 to 64, every one to three years; after 65, every one to two years; or as advised by a clinician. Discuss with clinician. Have this done during your routine physical or separately by a dermatologist. Routinely; discuss frequency with dentist. Yearly. One time only, at age 65. Get a Td booster every 10 years; substitute a Tdap booster if you are under 65 and never had one before; if you are over 65 get one booster shot ofTdap. Once only at age 60 or later; discuss with clinician.

**Hemorrhoid / Piles**

Hemorrhoids, also calledpiles, are[vascular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinusoid_(blood_vessel))structures in the[anal canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_canal).In their normal state, they are cushions that help with[stool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_feces)control.They become a disease when[swollen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swelling_(medical))or[inflamed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation); the unqualified term "hemorrhoid" is often used to refer to the disease.The signs and symptoms of hemorrhoids depend on the type present.Internal hemorrhoids often result in painless, bright red[rectal bleeding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematochezia)when[defecating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation). [External hemorrhoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_hemorrhoids) often result in pain and swelling in the area of the[anus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anus).If bleeding occurs it is usually darker.Symptoms frequently get better after a few days.A[skin tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_tag)may remain after the healing of an external hemorrhoid.

**Hernia**

Aherniais the abnormal exit of tissue or an[organ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(anatomy)), such as the[bowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowel), through the wall of the cavity in which it normally resides.Hernias come in a number of types.Most commonly they involve the[abdomen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen), specifically the groin.[Groin hernias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groin_hernia_(disambiguation))are most common of the [inguinal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inguinal_hernia) type but may also be[femoral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femoral_hernia).Other hernias include[hiatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiatus_hernia),[incisional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisional_hernia), and[umbilical hernias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilical_hernia). Symptoms are present in about 66% of people with groin hernias.This may include pain or discomfort especially with coughing, exercise, or going to the bathroom. Often it gets worse throughout the day and improves when lying down.A bulging area may occur that becomes larger when bearing down.Groin hernias occur more often on the right than left side.The main concern is[strangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangulation_(bowel)), where the blood supply to part of the bowel is blocked. This usually produces severe pain and tenderness of the area.Hiatus or hiatal hernias often result in[heartburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartburn)but may also cause chest pain or pain with eating.

**Anorexia**

An eating disorder characterized by markedly reduced appetite or total aversion to food.Anorexiais a serious psychological disorder. It is a condition that goes well beyond out-of-control dieting. The person withanorexia, most often a girl or young woman, initially begins dieting to lose weight.



**Boils**
-   A boil is a common, painful infection of a hair follicle and the surrounding skin. It begins as a red lump, then fills with pus as white blood cells rush in to fight the infection. Good home care can often clear up a single boil, also known as a skin abscess. A doctor's care is needed when a boil resists treatment or develops in certain vulnerable areas of the body.

![Symptoms of boils](media/Diseases---Tests-image4.jpg)
-   You may also have a general feeling of ill health, fatigue, or a fever, which is reason to call a doctor.
-   Most boils are caused by **staph bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus)**. When a scrape, cut, or splinter breaks the skin, the bacteria can enter a hair follicle and start an infection.
-   Not exactly, but the germs that cause boils (staph) are easily spread through skin-to-skin contact and contaminated objects. These bacteria usually do no harm unless they find a break in the skin. To avoid spreading staph, don't share towels, bedding, clothes, or sports gear while you have a boil. Avoid touching the boil, and keep it covered. Frequent hand washing can also help prevent spreading the bacteria.
    -   Since bacteria are everywhere in our environments and on many people's skin, the best defense against boils includes:
        -   Hand washing or use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer
        -   Careful cleaning of cuts, scrapes, and other wounds
        -   Keeping wounds covered
        -   Not sharing towels, sheets, razors, etc.
    -   Wash towels, sheets, and anything else in contact with an infected area in very hot water. Throw away any wound dressings in a tightly sealed bag.
    -   
-   **Types of Boil**
    -   **Carbuncle**

When several boils form close together and join beneath the skin, it's called a carbuncle. They are most commonly found on the back and the neck but can develop anywhere. Men are more likely to develop carbuncles than women. A carbuncle tends to lie deeper beneath the skin than a boil and can take longer to heal.

![Illustration of carbuncle](media/Diseases---Tests-image5.jpg)
-   Cystic Acne
-   Armpit and Groin (hidradenitis suppurativa)
-   Pilonidal Abscess
-   Stye

-   Anyone can develop a boil. The risk increases with:
    -   Close contact with an infected person
    -   Acne, eczema, or other causes of breaks in the skin
    -   Diabetes
    -   A weakened immune system
    -   Poor[nutrition](http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10192)
    -   Poor hygiene
    -   Exposure to harsh chemicals that irritate the skin


-   **Treatment**
    -   Apply warm, moist compresses several times a day to help a boil open and drain. After it starts draining, keep it clean, and continue using warm compresses -- a clean one every time. Change the bandage often and wash hands well. Resist the urge to squeeze or pop the boil. This can make the infection worse.
    -   When the boil starts draining, wash it with an antibacterial soap until all the pus is gone and clean with rubbing alcohol. Apply a medicated ointment (topical antibiotic) and a bandage. Continue to wash the infected area two to three times a day and to use warm compresses until the wound heals.


-   Warm compresses may promote the drainage and healing of carbuncles. Gently soak the carbuncle in warm water, or apply a clean, warm, moist washcloth for 20 minutes several times per day. Similar strategies include covering the carbuncle with a clean, dry cloth and gently applying a heating pad or hot water bottle for 20 minutes several times per day. After each use, washcloths or cloths should be washed in hot water and dried at a high temperature.
-   Washing the carbuncle and covering the area with a sterile bandage also may promote drainage and healing and help prevent the infection from spreading. Over-the-counter[medications](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx)such as[acetaminophen](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-362/acetaminophen+oral/details)or[ibuprofen](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/mono-9368-IBUPROFEN+-+ORAL.aspx?drugid=5166&drugname=ibuprofen+oral)can help relieve the pain of an inflamed carbuncle.
-   It's important to thoroughly[wash your hands](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cold-guide/cold-prevention-hand-washing)after touching a carbuncle. Launder any clothing, bedding, and towels that have touched a carbuncle and avoid sharing bedding, clothing, or other personal items.
-   Depending on severity, most carbuncles heal within two to three weeks after medical treatment.

-   **When to Call the Doctor**

If a boil doesn't heal after a week of home care, call your doctor. Other reasons to call include:
-   A boil on the face or spine
-   A fever or red streaks coming from the sore
-   A very large or painful boil
-   A boil that keeps coming back
-   The skin around the boil turns red or red streaks appear.
-   The pain becomes severe.
-   The boil does not drain.
-   A second boil appears.


-   **Complications**
    -   Sometimes, carbuncles are caused by methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus([MRSA](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-mrsa)) bacteria, and require treatment with potent prescription[antibiotics](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/rm-quiz-antibiotics-myths-facts)if the lesions are not drained properly.
