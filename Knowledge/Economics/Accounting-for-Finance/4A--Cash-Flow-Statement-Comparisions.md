**Sector and Industry Differences**
-   The statement of cash flows is perhaps the most direct of financial statements, since it is based upon cash flows in and cash flows out. It is thus the one statement that accounting game playing affects the least
-   While the objective of the statement might be explaining why the cash balance changes, it is the repository for all of the items needed to estimate cash flows
-   While it is not uncommon for income statements and cash flows to send divergent messages about a firm's financial well being, consistent differences between the two can be a indicator of accounting problems



**Bottom Line**
-   The statement of cash flows looks at cash flows through the eyes of the equity investors in a business
    -   Thus, if you are trying to compute cash flows to equity investors, all of the information you will need should be on the statement
    -   You should also be able to see what equity investors received as cash flows
-   If your objective is to estimate cash flows, prior to debt payments, you can start with the statement of cash. flows but you have to trace interest expenses (netted out to get to net income and add them back

![I. 2. 3. 4. 5. For each of the three companies, estimate the effect that changes in non-cash working capital are having (or taking away) on operating cash flows. What are the implications? Under operating cash flows, each company is adding back stock-based compensation. What is the rationale for doing so? a. Stock based compensation is not an expense b. Stock based compensation is not an accounting expense, but it is a cash expense c. Stock based compensation is an accounting expense, but it is not a cash expense d. Stock based compensation is a financing cash flow, not an operating cash flow e. None of the above For each of the three companies, estimate how much of the investing cash flow represents investment in operating assets and how much in non- operating assets. Why do we care? For each of the three companies, estimate how much total debt changed during the course of the year, based upon the financing cash flows. For each of the three companies, estimate how much was returned to stockholders in dividends and how much in net stock buybacks. What are the implications? ](media/Accounting-for-Finance_4A--Cash-Flow-Statement-Comparisions-image3.jpg)

![1. 2. 3. Session 4A: Post class test solutions Navistar and Google saw increases in non-cash working capital, leading to negative cash flows in the aggregate, but Nordstrom decreased non-cash working capital, creating a positive cash flow. (I did not include the tax increase in Google's CF statement in working capital). The implications are simple. If Nordstrom can continue to keep working capital in check or decrease it, its cash flows will benefit. Navistar Change in Acc.

Stock based compensation is an accounting expense, but it is not a cash expense. Stock based compensation is an expense, but since it uses shares or options, it does not affect the cash flows. (That said, it is very different from depreciation and amortization in its effects on investors)> All three companies invested in operating assets, with Google investing the most. All three companies reduced their holdings of non-operating assets, creating positive cash flows from that grouping. Investments in the former are what we look at in forecasting growth in operating metrics. The income from investments in the latter show up below the operating income line.

![5. Net CF from Debtl $ 188.00 | $ 700 | $ (276.00) | Navistar returned no cash to its stockholders and issued $5 million in stock, reflecting its cash flow constraints. Nordstrom returned cash in both dividends and buybacks, in roughly the same amounts. Google paid no dividends but did a significant stock buyback. Dividends are sticky and Nordstrom will have a difficult time decreasing them, if it needed to. Buybacks are not and Google can increase them or not do them next year, with little consequence.
