**Income Statement: A Life Cycle Perspective**

**Sector and Industry Differences**

The accounting standards that govern how companies measure revenues and earnings may be the same across companies, but there are some sector-specific differences
-   For commodity companies, the differences often arise from costs expended exploring for commodity reserves and extracting the commodity from reserves
-   For financial service companies, the challenge often lies in defining revenues and debt, since the latter is less a source of capital and more raw material



**Bottom Line**
-   Much is made of the differences in accounting standards around the world and across businesses, but the reality is that accounting standards are converging across the world, rather than diverging
-   While revenues come in different forms for different companies and operating expenses take varied forms, the end game with gross profit, operating and net income remains the same, i.e., to measure profits are different levels
-   In theory, you should be therefore able to compare these numbers across companies, but in practice, accounting inconsistencies in how the expenses get measured and categorized can create problems

![1. 2. Session 2A: Post class test solutions Navistar has the highest COGS, relative to revenue, and Google has the lowest. They reflect (a) Differences in business models. Navistar manufactures the equipment that it sells, Nordstrom marks up goods that its gets from others and Google's services cost little to produce. (b) Differences in accounting: Navistar's manufacturing business generates much higher depreciation charges which are part of COGS. Total Revenue Cost of Goods Sold Navistar Nordstrom $9,585.00 $ 15,524.00 $7,904.00 $ 9,932.00 COGS as % of Revenues 82.46% 63.98% GOO le 161,857.0 71,896.0 44.42% Most of the operating expenses at Navistar are from COGS, whereas Nordstrom and Google have a higher percent from SG&A expenses. If you assume that COGS are more likely to be variable and SG&A to be fixed, this becomes a rough proxy for economies of scale, with Nordstrom and Google benefiting more from scaling up.

Navistar's financing revenues and expenses reflect the presence of a captive financing division of the company, which finances the sales of Navistar equipment. 4. d. Taxes on taxable income in tax books, based upon tax code. Iftaxes were computed on the taxable income in the income statement, the taxes would be more reflective of the statutory tax rates, but they are not. 5. Currency gains and losses reflect the effect of movements in the US dollar against other currencies. The reason it can play out as a profit for some companies and a loss for others comes from the fact that it can affect both revenues and expenses. For companies that derive their revenues from outside the US, while their costs are in US dollars, a stronger dollar will cause losses, since foreign currency revenues will be devalued, after the currency adjustment. For companies that have costs in other currencies but revenues in US dollars, a stronger dollar will cause profits, since foreign currency costs will be lowered, after the currency adjustment. ](media/Accounting-for-Finance_2A-Income-Statement-Comparisions-image4.jpg)
