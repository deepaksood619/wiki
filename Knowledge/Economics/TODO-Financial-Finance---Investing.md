Alternative investments are of many types: There are hedge funds, private equity, commodities like agricultural produce, energy and metals, etc. Then there is real estate, venture capital, private debt placement, peer-to-peer lending, investing in start-ups, arts & antiques, vintage coins, stamps, etc. In addition to the higher returns most alternative investments are not linked to the stock markets or even the bond markets which then acts as an asset hedge and can be used by investors to diversify one's portfolio.

## P2P LENDING(Peer to peer lending)

In P2P lending programs depositors or lenders earn more interest on their money and likewise, more borrowers can get access to finance with customized approval procedures. In essence, P2P lending platforms like Faircent, Lendbox, LiquiLoans, RupeeCircle etc. act more as facilitators and risk mitigators. In the process, they provide a range of facilities which includes on-boarding, credit evaluation, agreement signing, disbursement of loans and collection services. Individual lenders can now select borrowers per their preferred loan criteria, location, profile, reason for loan loan tenure which is typically between 3 to 36 months and their desired rate of interest which ranges from 12 to 35%.

## FRACTIONAL REAL ESTATE

Traditionally, investing in real estate requires capital ranging from a few lakhs to a few crores. But now platforms like Strata, PropShare etc. have made it possible for retail investors to own commercial real estate in smaller proportions. The business model starts off with the fractional ownership platform identifying an investable Grade A property like a commercial building or a warehouse. Ofcourse, the properties that are identified almost always has an existing tenant who's been locked on a long-term contract which helps with cash flow visibility. Fractional ownership startups generally charge an annual asset management fee of about 1% and they also take in share of the profits over a particular hurdle rate. From an investor's perspective Like any real estate, the owner receives a monthly rental income which comes with built-in rent escalations. Additionally, the investor also benefits from the price appreciation that these properties have over the years.

## HIGH YIELDING FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS

For the last two years, fixed deposit investors have been a grieving lot with FD returns struggling to match the inflation rate. But now, we are seeing a boom in start-ups offering bonds, structured debt and other high yielding fixed income instruments to retail investors as they look to make a dent in the 1.5 trillion dollar fixed deposit market. One of these weapons of FD destruction are high yielding debt instruments which in addition to offering higher interest rates also allows investors to put in amounts as low as 10,000 rupees. Platforms like Wint Wealth, BondsKart, AltiFi etc. offer products like government bonds, AAA rated papers from lending institutions, high yielding BBB rated corporate bonds, private bond placements and also structured debt.

## INVOICE DISCOUNTING

There is usually a time lag between a vendor supplying goods or services and he getting paid for it. Now, to better manage cash flows during this period, vendors typically approach a bank or a financial institution who then purchases these receivables at a discount for upfront cash. Today, several platforms like KredX, Jiraaf, TradeCred etc. have skipped the banking connection and match vendors and investors who are keen to participate in this financial opportunity Now, invoices can run into lakhs and even crores which is why these platforms break up an invoice into manageable parts allowing investors to buy a fraction of the unpaid invoice amount. The minimum investment amount changes from deal to deal but we do see transactions starting from 50,000 rupees in some cases. These opportunities typically run for a short tenure of 30 to 90 days and the pre-tax IRR can be as high as 15%.

## counter cyclical fiscal policy

## Malinvestment - the action or fact of investing money in an ill-judged or wasteful way

A**consumer spendsmoney andfollowstrends** while an**investor puts capital to work**andtakes advantageof trends.

Chronic consumers often go broke, and persistent investors often get rich.

I don't want returns in % I want returns in X

Debt is a hedge against inflation

Us dollars as back-up currency in case of war

Investing should be more like watching paint dry or watching grass grow. If you want excitement, take $800 and go to Las Vegas

In a bear market, smart long-term decisions often look foolish in the short-term; whereas in a bull market foolish long-term decisions often look smart in the short-term.

You can't take the same actions as everyone else and expect to outperform

You can't hope to earn above average returns if you don't place active bets, but if your active bets are wrong, your return will be below average.

If you hope to distinguish yourself in terms of performance, you have to depart from the pack. But, having departed, the difference will only be positive if your choice of strategies and tactics is correct and/or you're able to execute better"

## Indian
-   Nifty 50 (NSE)
-   Nifty Next 50 (NSE)
-   Sensex (30% in BSE by free-float market capatiliation)
-   Motilal Oswal Nasdaq 100 Fund (Foreign index available in india)
-   Nippon BANKBEES ETF

<https://www.moneycontrol.com/mutual-funds/amc-details/RC>

## Since Nifty50 companies form over 75% of the free-float market capitalisation of Nifty100, the allocation of Nifty50 and Nifty Next50 could be 75:25 in the portfolio.

It is prudent to keep a third of the equity portfolio in mutual funds that invest in **foreign stocks.**

For foreign equity allocation, the ideal option would a fund like Vanguard Global Stock Index Fund that holds the biggest companies in developed countries in the proportion of their free-float market capitalisation. Since this option is not available for Indian investors, we can allocate up to 20% of the total equity portfolio in funds like Motilal Oswal Nasdaq 100 Fund of Fund. For taxation, these funds are treated like debt mutual funds; but that is fine since we diversify the portfolio to reduce risk not to increase the return.

## A better approach, therefore, is to take the middle path. Invest half the Indian equity investment in index funds (Nifty50 and Nifty Next50 with 75:25 allocation) and the remaining equally in 3 to 4 multicap funds managed by fund managers with a proven track record of over ten years. Up to 20% of the equity portfolio can be kept in foreign equity index funds.

[How To Retire Rich In Your 20's 🔥 | Financial Freedom 🔥 | 5 Rules Of Money 💸 |](https://youtu.be/LKRKTE33JR8)

## Financial Independence

<https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement>

## Finance Gratitude
-   **Entitlement**

rags to riches and back to rags stories of film stars, lottery ticket winners, and such other starkly high income earners who lost their wealth.

They would be surrounded by relatives and friends that systematically leached off the wealth or led them to poor quality investments. The man who won the first round of Kaun Banega Crorepati admitted that he bought houses for siblings and funded their businesses before losing his winnings and returning to his old job in a few years. Easy money belongs to everyone---that seems to be the credo.


-   Do not disclose your earnings, income or wealth. No one other than your spouse and children at an appropriate age need to know. What you give is always measured with respect to what you make. In itself, a gift of 50,000 at a relative's wedding is substantial. It might be bigger than what others gave. But if it is known that you earn Rs.5 lakh every month, that is seen as too little.


-   Keep control and equity about who will receive your charities. Someone is not ahead of the queue only because they are related to you or your spouse. You make the decision because it is your money and you know who deserves it. Putting a dozen poor children through college is better than enabling a sibling to upgrade their car. You don't have to justify that decision.


-   Money given away to those around you who behave with a sense of entitlement, is almost never returned. You mostly lose the money and the relationship if you asked. Earmark an amount you can afford to write off. Limit your commitment to that amount and no more.


-   Do not respond to a request for funds with an immediate yes or no. The yes will be seen as too willing; the no will be seen as too rude. Try a response like: let me think about this and come back to you. That gives you the time and those that were taking a shot at asking may not come back. Just as we do not invest in a do-it-right-now investment option, giving also need not be an immediate response.


-   Do not try to use your money to buy friendships and relationships. A very common mistake that the moneyed make is to use the power of their wealth to be surrounded by followers and ego massaging yes men. These are poor investments. None of these last when your money is gone. You are aware of your importance in the family due to your wealth; learn to use it wisely.


-   Make rules that indicate how you will decide whom to support. Keep it equitable between both spouses. Discuss how you will support both parents; how you will contribute to old age support and hospitalizations; and so on. Identify specific causes like education and the limits you will go towards funding it. Allocate a percentage of your earnings and be gracious about it to the outside world, but clear and rule based within the household.
