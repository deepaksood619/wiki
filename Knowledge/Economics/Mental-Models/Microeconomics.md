Microeconomics(from Greek prefixmikro-meaning "small" +economics) is a branch of[economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics)that studies the behaviour of individuals and[firms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_the_firm) in making decisions regarding the allocation of[scarce resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity)and the interactions among these individuals and firms.



One goal of microeconomics is to analyze the[market mechanisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_mechanism)that establish[relative prices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_price)among goods and services and allocate limited resources among alternative uses. Microeconomics shows conditions under which free markets lead to desirable allocations. It also analyzes[market failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure), where markets fail to produce[efficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market_efficiency)results.

**The Demand Curve**

![CONSUMCRS PRICE vow VAL.uc use CONSUVERS QUANTITY ](media/Mental-Models_Microeconomics-image1.png)
-   A Demand Curve is a function that shows the quantity demanded at different prices
    -   The Quantity Demanded is the quantity that buyers are willing (and able) to purchase at a particular price
-   Demand curves can be read in two ways
    -   Horizontally - The quantity buyers are willing and able to purchase at a given price
    -   Vertically - the maximum price that buyers are willing to pay for a given unit of oil

-   **Consumer surplus** is the consumer's gain from exchange
    -   the difference between the mazimum price a consumer is willing to pay for a given quantity and the market price
-   **Total consumer surplus** is the sum of consumer surplus of all buyers
-   Graphically, total consumer surplus is measured by the **area below the demand curve and above the price.**

-   An **increase in demand** means an increase in quantity demanded at every given price or (in other words) an increase in the maximum willingness to pay for each given quantity
-   What would cause an increase in demand?
    -   Anything that increases the quantity demanded at a given price or that increases the maximum willingness to pay for a given quantity
-   A **decrease in demand** means a decrease in quantity demanded at every given price or (in other words) a decrease in the maximum willingness to pay for each given quantity



**Demand Shifters (Income, Population, Substitutes, Complements, Expectations, Tastes)**
-   The effect of changes in income on demand **depends on the nature of the good in question**
-   A **Normal Good:** demand increases when income increases (and vice versa)
-   An **Inferior Good:** demand decreases when income increases (and vice versa)
-   Ex - When I was a student, I used to eat more at McD, but now when my income increased I eat at better restaurants, so McD consumption decreases with the rise in income.
-   Two goods are **Substitutes** if an increase in the price of one good leads to an increase in demand for the other good (or vice versa)
-   Two goods are **Complements** if an increase in the price of one good leads to an decrease in the demand for the other (or vice versa)
    -   Ex - Petrol car and Petrol (if price increases for one, there is a decrease in demand for the other)
-   The **expectation** of a higher (lower) price for a good in the future increases (decreases) current demand for the good
    -   Consumers will adjust their current spending **in anticipation of the direction of future prices** in order to obtain the lowest possible price.
-   Tastes and preferences are subjective and will vary among consumers



**Change in Demand vs Change in Quantity Demanded**

**The supply curve**
-   Supply represents the behavior of sellers
-   A **Supply Curve** is a function that shows the quantity supplied at different prices
    -   The **Quantity Supplied** is the quantity that producers are willing and able to sell at a particular price

**The equilibrium price and quantity**

The market process works like an invisible hand to promote the social good -- Adam Smith



**GDP - CIGx**
-   **C - Consumption** (Phones, Toys, Non-Pirated Textbooks)
-   **I - Investment** (Bought but not consumed - Factories, Machines, Homes)
-   **G - Government Spending**
-   **NX - Net Exports** (Sold overseas)



**DiscretionaryExpense**

A discretionary[expense](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expense.asp)is a cost that a business or household can survive without, if necessary. Discretionary expenses are often defined as nonessential spending. This means a business or household is still able to maintain itself even if all discretionary[consumer spending](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-spending.asp)stops.



Meals at restaurants and entertainment costs are examples of discretionary expenses.
