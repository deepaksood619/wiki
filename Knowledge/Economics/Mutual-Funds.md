## Nifty VIX (India Volatility Index)

TheIndia Volatility Indexin short is termed India VIX. It indicates the degree of volatility or fluctuation traders expect over the next 30 days in the Nifty50 Index

[How to Measure Mutual Fund Risk | Alpha, Beta, SD, Sharpe, R-squared, Sortino | Learn with ETMONEY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU45evtcc90)

1.  **BETA**

Beta is a commonly used risk measure and calculates the relative volatility of a stock or mutual fund's returns as against its benchmark. the beta merely explains the relative riskiness of an asset and does not give us the inherent risk of the asset itself.

As an investor, you can use this information on the beta to align your mutual fund portfolio according to your risk appetite. For instance, if you are a conservative investor, you might want to focus on low beta portfolios. But remember what we said earlier beta is a relative measure and does not give us the inherent risk of an asset.

2.  **ALPHA**

Alpha quite simply measures how much better a fund has performed as compared to its benchmark index.

For instance, if the Nifty 50 delivered 10% this past year and your fund did 11% .. then the alpha is +1%. And if your fund underperformed and achieved only 8% .. then the alpha is -2%. This means actively managed funds can have positive or negative alpha depending on how well the fund manager runs the fund. In fact, creating positive alpha is the entire essence behind someone investing in an actively managed fund

3.  **R-SQUARED**

The R-Squared aims to measure a fund's correlation to its benchmark performance. This is done on a scale of 100 which means if the R-Squared is a 100 then it shows that the performance of the mutual fund is perfectly correlated with the performance of the benchmark

This particularly the case when it comes to index funds that have an R-Squared of 99 or 100. On the other end, we typically see actively managed mutual funds which can have a range of R-squared values

4.  **STANDARD DEVIATION**

The standard deviation measures the dispersion of data from its mean and from a mutual fund perspective, it represents the volatility or riskiness of the fund. For instance, let's say a mutual fund delivers 10% average returns over a period of time. But as expected, this fund has had some good months and also some bad months with returns vacillating between +20% and -15%

This up and down trajectory of returns in the mutual fund NAV is what standard deviation captures and presents as an annualized number

5.  **SHARPE RATIO**

The Sharpe ratio measures risk-adjusted performance .. and is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate of return from the fund's returns .. and then dividing the result by the standard deviation. In other words, the Sharpe ratio indicates whether a mutual fund's returns are due to the wise investment decisions taken by the fund manager ... or was it the result of taking excessive risk

Like many statistical tools, the Sharpe ratio too can lead to some misleading inferences if used in isolation. For example, it's commonly possible that a fund with low returns and low standard deviation might show a high Sharpe ratio

6.  **SORTINO RATIO**

The Sharpe ratio uses the total volatility in its calculations in the form of standard deviation. This is where the Sortino ratio is different as it only uses only the fund's downside standard deviation in its calculations

So as a formula, the Sortino ratio is much like the Sharpe Ratio subtracts the risk-free returns from the fund returns but instead of dividing it by the total standard deviation .. it divides the difference with the downside deviation

This ratio is particularly useful for risk-averse or conservative investors and in the real sense, determines the success of a fund in capping its downside volatility. The Sortino ratio is a useful way for all kinds of investors, analysts and portfolio managers to evaluate a fund's return for a given level of bad risk.

## Thumb rule way of remembering
-   A high Alpha, a high Sharpe ratio and a high Sortino indicate better potential performance for a fund
-   A low Beta and a low standard deviation indicates lower volatility for the fund
-   A higher R-Squared indicates a better correlation with the benchmark
-   **Max Alpha with minimum beta**

## Alpha

Alpha isnotan excess return! Alpha is excess return calculated on a risk-adjusted basis.


-   Jensen's alpha = (excess return of index wrt risk-free instrument) -- (a measure of relative volatility wrt nifty 50) x (excess market return wrt risk-free instrument)
-   the excess return of index wrt risk-free instrument = index return -- MIBOR return
-   the excess return of market -- nifty 50 -- wrt risk-free instrument = nifty 50 return -- MIBOR return.
-   relative volatility wrt nifty 50 = beta.
-   Alpha = (Stock return -- risk-free return) -- (Benchmark return -- risk-free return) x beta

Alpha factors in how volatile a fund has been compared to the market. A stock/fund that beats the market but is more volatile than the market in doing so will have lower alpha than a fund with lower volatility. Thus even funds with no excess returns can "produce an alpha".

## Jensen's Measure

The Jensen's measure, or Jensen's alpha, is a risk-adjusted performance measure that represents the average return on a portfolio or investment, above or below that predicted by the **capital asset pricing model (CAPM)**, given the portfolio's or investment's beta and the average market return. This metric is also commonly referred to as simply alpha.
-   The Jensen's measure is the difference in how much a person returns vs. the overall market.
-   Jensen's measure is commonly referred to as alpha. When a manager outperforms the market concurrent to risk, they have "delivered alpha" to their clients.
-   The measure accounts for the risk-free rate of return for the time period.

[Picking Stocks for Long term Investing in 2021 | Investment Strategy for Beginners | Ankur Warikoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krwSDbuHWd4)

Alpha - Excess return above the benchmark

Beta - Measurement of risk or volatility

## Equity Risk Premium
-   An equity risk premium is an excess return earned by an investor when they invest in the stock market over a risk-free rate
-   This return compensates investors for taking on the higher risk of equity investing
-   Determining an equity risk premium is theoretical because there's no way to tell how well equities or the equity market will perform in the future
-   Calculating an equity risk premium requires using historical rates of return

## Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) describes the relationship between systematic risk and[expected return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expectedreturn.asp)for assets, particularly stocks.CAPM is widely used throughout finance for pricing risky[securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp)and generating expected returns for assets given the risk of those assets and[cost of capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofcapital.asp).

## What is a factor-based index?

An index created by active stock selection using conditions such as low volatility, momentum, alpha, quality, value etc. and not market capitalization is called a factor index. Stocks in the index are weighted using these factors -- for eg. lower volatility stock has a higher weight. So this combines active stock-picking -- quantitative, rule-based -with passive investing (if an ETF or index fund follows this index).

## What is a multi-factor index?

This is an index constructed with two or more factors or rules. For example, there are four multi-factor indices launched by the NSE:1.NIFTY Alpha Low-Volatility 30 = 50% alpha + 50% low volatility.2.NIFTY Quality Low-Volatility 30 = 50% quality + 50% low volatility.3.NIFTY Alpha Quality Low-Volatility 30 = 1/3 Alpha + 1/3 Quality + 1/3 Low Vol.4.NIFTY Alpha Quality Value Low-Volatility 30 = 25% Alpha + 25% Quality + 25% Value + 25%Low Volatility.

## What is the benefit of a factor-index?

Unlike a market-cap based index, a factor-index often (not always) has a weighting cap of, for example, 5%. This lowers concentration risk. Depending on the rule used, a factor-based index can from time to time (not always) offer lower risk and/or higher returns than a market-cap based index.

## What is the benefit of a multi-factor index?

This provides diversification in the rules. When an index house or fund house projects a single factor index or ETF, they would tell you "why a single-factor is better than a usual index". They would leave out the fact that a single factor may not work all the time or can be riskier. When they a project a multi-factor index or ETF they would go "Multi-factors counters the impact of the cyclicality of single-factor indices".

## Arbitrage Mutual Funds

An[arbitrage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arbitrage.asp)fund is a type of[mutual fund](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/091115/are-mutual-funds-considered-equity-securities.asp)that appeals to investors who want to profit from volatile markets without taking on too much risk.

Arbitrage funds work by exploiting the price differential between assets that should theoretically have the same price. One of the most important types of arbitrage takes place between the cash and[futures markets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futuresmarket.asp). A typical fund purchases stocks with the hope of selling them later after the price has gone up. Instead, an arbitrage fund purchases stock in the cash market and simultaneously sells that interest in the futures market. The differences between stock prices and[futures contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futurescontract.asp)are usually very small. As a result, arbitrage funds must execute a large number of trades each year to make any substantial gains.

-   Strategy index funds
-   Sector based index funds
-   International index funds
-   Debt index funds
-   Custom index funds

An index fund is a fund that holds all the stocks in the underlying index to mimic the overall performance of that index. At present, Nifty50 and Nifty Next50 are two best index fund options available for investors in India. These funds mimic the portfolio of the Nifty and Nifty Next50 Index, respectively.

Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE) are the two biggest stock exchanges in India. There are approximately 4500 listed companies on BSE and around 1600 listed companies on NSE. Most big companies are listed on both stock exchanges. Sensex is the stock market index of BSE, while Nifty is that of NSE.

The top 100 companies based on full market capitalisation listed on NSE are called Nifty100. Full market capitalisation is the current price of stock multiplied by the total number of stocks of the company. Or in simple words, it is the amount an investor needs to spend if he wants to purchase 100% ownership of the company.

Nifty50 index represents the top 50 companies from Nifty100 based on free-float market capitalisation. Free float market capitalisation is the market capitalisation calculated after excluding shares held by promoters and strategic investors.

Nifty Next50 Index represents 50 companies from Nifty100 after excluding the Nifty50 companies. Likewise, Sensex represents the top 30 companies listed on BSE by free-float market capitalisation.

The weight of each stock in the index depends on its free-float market capitalisation. Higher the free-float market capitalisation of the company, higher its allocation in the index. At present, HDFC Bank is the biggest company in India by free-float market capitalisation; therefore, its weight is highest in both Nifty and Sensex. If the free-float market capitalisation of another Nifty business is 1/10th of HDFC Bank, its weight in Nifty would be 1/10th of HDFC Bank's weight.

Since the weight of each stock in the index depends on its free-float market capitalisation, which depends on the stock price, when the stock price of any company goes up, its weight in the index goes up. Likewise, weight of any business whose stock price goes down also automatically comes down. If any company is no longer in the top 50 companies by free-float market capitalisation, it is replaced by another successful company. In any calendar year, a maximum of five businesses can be replaced. These changes in the index are done semi-annually.

Nifty50 index value is calculated using the following formula:

Nifty50 Index Value = (Current total free-float market capitalisation of Nifty50 companies/total free-float market capitalisation of Nifty50 companies on Nov 03, 1995) * 1000

Though the Nifty50 index fund mimics the portfolio of the Nifty50 index, the returns from the index fund are higher than that of the Nifty50 index return. This happens because the dividend index fund scheme receives is reinvested in the portfolio. Nifty50 value doesn't reflect the effect of dividend reinvestment.

Index funds benefit from price discovery by the collective wisdom of the market. It is tough to outguess the market and generate a higher return.

Another big reason most actively managed funds underperform index funds is their higher expenses. Actively managed funds charge significantly higher expense compared to index funds (the expense ratio of HDFC Equity Fund-Direct Plan is 1.27% per annum as against 0.1% expense of HDFC Index Fund Nifty 50 Plan-Direct Plan).

## Should I switch to Index Funds?
-   First learn to invest with a strategy
-   Select an asset allocation for your need
-   Learn how to manage risk systematically
-   Then once confident, you can become an index investor

## REIT (Real Estate Investment Trusts) / Real Estate Mutual Funds

<https://cleartax.in/s/reit-funds

Categories of actively managed equity mutual fund schemes
-   Largecap: At least 80% in largecap
-   Midcap: At least 65% in midcap
-   Smallcap: At least 65% in smallcap
-   Large & midcap: At least 35% each in largecap and midcap
-   **Multicap: At least 65% in equities and no market-cap wise restriction**

In the multicap category, the allocation decision is left to the fund manager who is better equipped to take allocation decision compared to retail investors and their advisers. The fund manager doesn't have a restricted mandate, and therefore, he is free to invest where he finds better opportunities.
-   Sectoral/Thematic: At least 80% in the chosen sector stocks
-   Focused: At least 65% in equities and a maximum of 30 stocks in the portfolio.
-   Dividend Yield: At least 65% in equities but in dividend-yielding stocks
-   Value/Contra: At least 65% in equities, the scheme should follow value or contra investment strategy.
-   ELSS: At least 80% in equities, lock-in of 3 years and tax benefit under section 80C

## A Probit Model: Hostile Acquisitions
-   While there are no easy pathways to making money, it seems clear that investors in companies that are targeted in acquisitions (especially hostile ones) earn high returns, but only if they invest before the event
-   There are probit models for predicting companies that will be targeted, and they involve:
    -   You start with all firms that publicly traded at the start of a period
    -   The dependent variable becomes the stand-in for whether a firm is targeted in a hostile acquisition
    -   The independent variables reflect what you believe are key drivers of hostile acquisitions, including poor stock price performance, lagging accounting returns and managers with little or no shareholdings
    -   You build a probit model that will yield as output an equation that resembles a regression, but will yield a probability of a hostile acquisition
