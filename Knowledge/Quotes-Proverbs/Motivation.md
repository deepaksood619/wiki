One of the most important keys to achievement is having the drive and discipline to do what you know you should do, especially when you don't feel like doing it. Your ability and willingness to do the difficult thing makes life easier.

## Deliberate Practice

## Grit is passion and perseverance for long term goals

## Do things, learn from them, repeat

## Invest in Yourself

## No self doubt (be bold)

Duty is joy

## DREAM BIG

## All things start small

## Little Big Things

## Getting Started

## Hope is a waking dream - Nelson Mandela

## Does this activity fill me with energy or drain me of energy?

## What are you working on when time fades away?

You have to dream before your dreams can come true -- Maulana Kalam Azad

The antidote to a bad day is a good workout.

The more you move, the easier it is to keep moving. Maintain the momentum.

Many people wish they started sooner. Almost nobody wishes they started later.

If you work, inspiration will come.

If you wait, inspiration will too.

Entrepreneur's mind.

Athlete's body.

Artist's soul.

It always seems impossible until it's done -- Nelson Mandela

## If not now, when, if not me then who

If I think I have won, the game is over for me!

"Just have one good day. Then repeat."

Whether it is easy or hard, never lose your focus as to where you want to go. -- Sadhguru

Happiness starts with you -- not with your relationships, job, or money.

The more disciplined your environment is, the less disciplined you need to be. Don't swim upstream.

Laziness is nothing more than the habit of resting before you get tired -- Jules Renard

Motivation comes and goes. If you want to do something consistently, then don't pick a level of difficulty that requires great motivation.

Make it easy enough and simple enough that you'll do it even when you don't feel very motivated.

To reduce stress, start sooner. To be happy, learn to finish what you started.

The hardest thing to do is leaving your comfort zone. But you have to let go of the life you're familiar with and take the risk to live the life you dream about

Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder by Nassim Nicholas Taleb

## Antifragile

- Bones
- Immune System
- Children

[Jonathan Haidt: The Three Terrible Ideas Weakening Gen Z and Damaging Universities and Democracies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5IGyHNvr7E)

"Raise your ambitions. Lower your expectations.

The higher your ambitions, the bolder your actions.

The lower your expectations, the greater your satisfaction.

Achieve more and be happy along the way."

My success mantra is really straightforward -- set 10X goals, work 10X as hard, provide 10X the value to clients, and make the lives everyone involved better. I think one should keep improving every month since you lose when you stop.

Crying is all right in its way while it lasts. But you have to stop sooner or later, and then you still have to decide what to do -- C.S. Lewis

"Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it."

## Genius - to have a disinterested obsession with something that matters

<http://paulgraham.com/genius.html>

When making plans, think big, When making progress, think small.

Knowledge and Action

what you learn is RIGHT and the actions you take is CORRECT

The foundation of all achievement is action

Most big, deeply satisfying accomplishments in life take at least five years to achieve. This can include building a business, cultivating a loving relationship, writing a book, getting in the best shape of your life, raising a family, and more.

Five years is a long time. It is much slower than most of us would like. If you accept the reality of slow progress, you have every reason to take action today. If you resist the reality of slow progress, five years from now you'll simply be five years older and still looking for a shortcut.

Optimism isn't a belief that everything will go well all the time. It's a belief that despite the inevitable challenges, we will make progress. We need more of it.

## How you are motivated

1. You are motivated by others success use that to drive yourself

## State of Flow - 4 conditions

1. Focus - When your life is on the line, it's easy to focus, belive that what you need to do is very important (when people say that your goal must be bigger than yourself)

2. Challenge skill balance - Challenge must be slightly harder than your skillset, you cannot overwhelm yourself, or too low. Flow exists between 45 degree angle between anxiety and boredom. The only easy day was yesterday. It should be slightly harder from the last time everyday.

3. Clear goals (specific with immediate feedback)

4. Flow is 4 state

    a.  priming/overwhelm don't attach to frustration

    b.  release (sex/walk/drive)

    c.  Learning and memory consolidation state

    d.  Struggle

## Story

"Todd, what do you think about writing only when you feel motivated? I feel like I always do my best work when I get a spark of creativity or inspiration, but that only happens every now and then. I'm pretty much only writing when I feel like it, which means I'm inconsistent. But if I write all the time, then I'm not creating my best work."

"That's cool," Todd replied. "I only write when I'm motivated too. I just happened to be motivated every day at 8am."

## Psychology of self-motivation

## Teddy/Theodore Roosevelt's famous speech titled "The Man in the Arena"

"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."

## Relentless by Tim Grover

Tim Groverwas the athletic trainer used by Michael Jordan (and many elite NBA players). Here he is describing the three things he asks of every player:

"I don't care how much you can lift, how fast you can run, how many pull-ups you can do, or whether you can hit a three while blindfolded. There are only three things I ask of every client... Show up, work hard, and listen. That's it. It requires no talent, no special genetics, or any skill whatsoever to show up, work hard, and listen."

He adds:

"When I train my athletes, it's a dictatorship withthree rules: show up, work hard, and listen. If you can do those three things, I can help you. If you can't we have no use for each other. I will bust my ass for you every way possible, but I expect you to do the same for yourself. I'm not going to work harder than you do for your benefit. Show me you want it, and I'll give it to you."

## Qualities that lead to increasing intelligence

1. The curiosity to experiment and explore.

2. The honesty to observe the world as it is, not as you wish it to be.

3. The humility to kill your favorite ideas when you learn something new.

4. The consistency to repeat this cycle for life.

Three common patterns to the problem of motivation:

1. **DRIVE:** You don't have a strong enough drive to learn.

2. **ANXIETY:** You have too strong an aversion to learning.

3. **DISTRACTION:** You have something else that motivates you more.

The fact that you go to the gym even though you don't "need" to... is why you don't need to.

The fact that you save when you could spend... is why you have money to spend.

Your habits create your strength.

When you build a habit, you don't have to spend mental energy deciding what to do -- The Heart to State by David Kadavy

It'sneveras bad as you think it is at the time, and there is always a silver lining -- The Golden rule of career catastrophes

You can make any job a work of art if you put the right energy into it.

Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever. -- Gandhi

<https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/annus-mirabilis>

Luck favors the prepared Mind -- Pasteur

We cannot control our luck---good or bad---but we can control our effort and preparation.

Luck smiles on us all from time to time. And when it does, the way to honor your good luck is to work hard and make the most of it.

Being pleasant and having a good attitude is a simple way to become luckier.

Opportunities come through people, and people are more likely to bring opportunities to people they like.

It's hard to win if your attitude adds friction to every interpersonal experience.

If others would think as hard as I did, then they would get similar results -- Newton

The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity

Health is not just being disease-free. Health is when every cell in your body is bouncing with life. -- Sadhguru

"You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading ittoday." -- Abraham Lincoln

It doesn't take any great intellect or qualifications to create something wonderful, just absolute devotion towards what you wish to do. -- Sadhguru

Remember don't HOPE for a fantastic week, hope is not a strategy! Let's make it so! :) --Jim Kwik

Making progress in your health, your work, and your life isn't about learning how to focus and concentrate better, it's about learning how to choose and commit to a specific task. -- James Clear

In the long-run (and often in the short-run), your willpower will never beat your environment.

Practice is the price you pay today to be better tomorrow.

The essence of Inner Engineering is to engineer yourself in such a way that every moment of your life is a new possibility. -- Sadhguru

Nothing wonderful is ever going to happen unless we actively make it happen. -- Sadhguru

There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it.-- Edith Wharton

Success will come easy once you function at your full potential. -- Sadhguru

When life doesn't challenge you, challenge yourself.

Those who know how to learn... know enough. - - Henry Adams

Do not think about enlightenment -- look at your limitations and how to go beyond them. That's the way to progress. -- Sadhguru

Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.

John Gardner, a politician and a recipient of the 1964 Presidential Medal of Freedom, on how to live a meaningful life:

"There's a myth that learning is for young people. But as the proverb says, 'It's what you learn after you know it all that counts.' The middle years are great, great learning years. Even the years past the middle years. I took on a new job after my 77th birthday -- and I'm still learning. Learn all your life. Learn from your failures. Learn from your successes, When you hit a spell of trouble, ask 'What is it trying to teach me?' The lessons aren't always happy ones, but they keep coming

If every moment of your life, no matter what the nature of your work or your life situations, you can remain playful and exuberant, that means you are liberated. -- Sadhguru

The one who follows the crowds will usually get no further than the crowd. The one who walks alone, is likely to find himself in places no one has ever been.

If you are content with who you are right now, you are not aware who you could be if you are willing to strive. -- Sadhguru

Tough times never last, but tough people do.

Always seeking the unknown and believes the impossible is just lack of trying

"Without hard work, a great strategy remains a dream.

Without a great strategy, hard work becomes a nightmare."

To achieve great things, two things are needed: a plan, and not quite enough time. -- Leonard Bernstein

Patience and perseverance, if we have them, overcome mountains of difficulties -- Mahatma Gandhi

"Someday" is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you."---Tim Ferriss

"If the only reason you're not pursuing a dream is because of the length of time it will take to achieve it, you should start right now. Think long-term."

"The difference between motion and action.

Motion:

-talk to a personal trainer

-research your book idea

-explore different types of meditation

Action:

-do 10 squats

-write 1 sentence

-meditate for 1 minute

## Motion feels like progress. Action is progress."

"If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the people to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast endless sea."

To create anything, you need to invest in yourself.

The most overlooked and underappreciated growth strategy is patience.

(More specifically, consistently producing great work over a long time horizon.)

A small body of determined spirits fired by an unquenchable faith in their mission can alter the course of history. -- Mahatma Gandhi

When you are offered a seat on a rocket ship you don't ask which seat

Most people think they lack motivation when they really lack clarity.

What looks like talent is often careful preparation.

What looks like skill is often persistent revision.

Some people want it happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen

Failure is the **condiment** that gives sucess its flavor

Know what you want. Be flexible about how to get there.

If you constantly see how to stretch your physical, mental, emotional, and perceptional limitations, your life is one big adventure. -- Sadhguru

"My best skill was that I was coachable. I was a sponge and aggressive to learn." -Michael Jordan

You can borrow knowledge, but not action.

Successful outcomes are never the result of a single choice. They are built up through good choices over time.

A profitable business is never a choice, it is a series of choices.

A fit body is never a choice, it is a series of choices.

A strong relationship is never a choice, it is a series of choices.

If one asked permission there was a 50% chance it would be refused. If one just got on with it, 19 times out of 20 nothing was said.

If you are content with who you are right now, you are not aware of who you could be if you were willing to strive. -- Sadhguru

Lethargy essentially comes from overconsumption of either food or thought. -- Sadhguru

Read more books and the books get more interesting.

Your favorite athlete's first workout was just as bad as yours.

Your favorite chef's first meal was just as bad as yours.

Your favorite artist's first work was just as bad as yours.

Keep going.

"Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are.

-The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.

-The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner.

-The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.

This year, focus on the identity you want to build."

Don't become a wandering generality. Be a meaningful specific

There are nearly endless opportunities to improve each day and finding them largely boils down to being curious.

People who are better in the end are usually curious in the beginning

There is no way to happiness. Happiness is the way.

C - Chunk it out

H - Have a go

A - Assess your results

M - Maintain your mindset

P - People (hang out with the right people)

I - Investigate the best

O - Own the outcome

N - Never give up

"The Process:

1) Decide what you want to achieve.

2) Try different ways of achieving it until you find one that works for you.

3) Do more of what works. Do less of what doesn't.

4) Don't stop doing it until it stops working.

5) Repeat."

## Blinkist - The Art of Impossible By Steven Kotler

The Art of Impossible(2021) is a science-driven guide to reaching your maximum potential. By developing four key skills --⁠ motivation, learning, creativity, and flow --⁠ you'll gain the power to smash whatever goals you set. With enough time, you may even achieve the impossible.

## What's in it for me? Reach your maximum potential and achieve the impossible

There are two kinds of impossible. One is **Impossible**, with a capitalI. These "Impossible" feats break paradigms and shatter expectations --⁠ think landing on the moon or running a four-minute mile.

Then, there's **impossible** with a lowercasei. This sort of impossible still lies beyond your wildest dreams --⁠ but on a personal scale. It's the stuff you think is impossiblefor you. It could be becoming an entrepreneur, building a musical career, or simply doing what you love for a living.

## Intrinsic motivators drive us toward the impossible

There are no two ways about it: your journey to impossible is going to be long and arduous. As with any long journey, you'll need fuel to keep you going. That includes food and sleep, but you also need psychological fuel --⁠ in other words, drive.

Drive, or motivation, nudges us toward action. But what creates drive in the first place? From an evolutionary perspective, it's all about surviving in a world where resources are scarce. Drive is evolution's way of getting us to either fight each other to obtain the resources we need or to use creativity to makemoreresources.

But drive doesn't consist of just one thing. There are various drivers, like fear, curiosity, and passion. All of these provide psychological fuel --⁠ and you can harness them to achieve the impossible.

All psychological drivers are divided into one of two categories:**extrinsicorintrinsic**. Extrinsic drivers are things like **money, fame, food, and sex.** They're external to ourselves, and we chase them to win the evolutionary survival game. Intrinsic drivers, on the other hand, are within us. They're psychological and emotional concepts like curiosity, passion, meaning, and purpose.

Psychological research tells us that extrinsic drivers only motivate us to a certain extent. They get weaker once we have enough money to pay for food, clothing, and shelter. After we've met these basic needs, it's the intrinsic motivators that take over. It's those intrinsic drivers we'll be focusing on in these blinks.

The five most powerful intrinsic motivators are **curiosity, passion, purpose, autonomy, and mastery.** You can stack them together so they feed off one another --⁠ and so you can achieve the impossible.

- Write down --⁠ by hand --⁠ 25 things you're curious about

When you explore your curiosities, your brain rewards you with small amounts of a feel-good chemical known as **dopamine**.

- What you need is passion, which provides a much greater dopamine boost. Often, you can find your passions by looking for intersections among your curiosities.
- Autonomy simply means the freedom to pursue your purpose. To cultivate it, try carving out at least 15 percent of the day just for yourself. This will help increase your motivation.
- mastery --⁠ the desire to get better at the things you do. For this motivator, you need to get into a special state of mind psychologists call **flow**.

## Break up the impossible into large and small goals

According to Latham, big goals lead to the largest increases in motivation and productivity. These are called**high, hard goals, or HHGs** for short. They're the major steps on your way to achieving your purpose. Your HHG might be, for instance, getting a degree in nutrition or starting a company.

HHGs can take years to achieve. So you'll need smaller daily targets along the way. Let's call these**clear goals**; theytake you closer to your HHGs. Say you're a writer, and your HHG is to pen a novel. One of your clear goals might be to write 500 words every day between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m.

Completing your clear goals will reward you with dopamine. Even so, endless persistence can be tough. That's where **grit** comes in --⁠ the energy it takes to push through years of hard work. Some people are more naturally gritty than others. But don't worry if that's not you. It's a skill you can improve.

One way to cultivate grit is to work around your natural energy levels. Willpower is a major aspect of grit, and it deteriorates throughout the day. So schedule your most difficult daily task for the morning, when your energy is at its peak. Then, continue your tasks in order of descending importance.

As you complete goals, your brain rewards your persistence with dopamine. Grit will become easier --⁠ and the impossible will become more realistic.

## Creativity requires activating three different networks in the brain

Now, neuroscientists know a little bit more about what creativity is neurologically. It involves two different networks in the brain working in tandem: **attention** and **imagination**.

Attention allows us to concentrate and make choices. Imagination takes care of what happens when our minds wander --⁠ whether it's daydreaming, making plans, or imagining future scenarios.

When we're thinking creatively, these two systems are working in tandem --⁠ something they don't normally do. Creative people can keep both systems active at once, seamlessly switching from attention to imagination and back. That's exactly what you'll need to learn to do if you want to cultivate creativity.

## Salience network

The job of this network is to let you know that an idea you've just had is worth your attention. It also controls your ability to shift between your attention and imagination faculties. And, importantly, it also conducts **repetition suppression**. That means it suppresses familiar stimuli so that you experience them as normal rather than new and exciting. But in creatives, the salience network **doesn't** engage in repetition suppression in the same way. That means they tend to notice beauty and novelty where others may not.

## A positive mood boosts your creativity

## Insight**, it turns out, is core to creativity. And you don't just have to wait for it to suddenly appear. Instead, you can cultivate it. How? By strengthening a particular part of the brain called the**anterior cingulate cortex, or ACC, which is part of the salience network

Brain-imaging studies have shown that the ACC lights up right before we solve a problem using "aha" insight. So what can make the ACC more active? The answer is simpler than you might think. Put simply --⁠ a good mood.

Bad moods lead to analytical thought. That makes sense because when you feel threatened or scared, your brain wants to search for what's familiar. It makes a beeline for the path of action it knows will work.

But when you're in a good mood, the opposite is true. You don't feel threatened, and your mind is free to wander. It can switch between the attention and imagination networks. This allows you to pay attention to new, different, maybe slightly weird possibilities --⁠ and then act on them.

So how do you cultivate a good mood? There are many ways, including a daily gratitude practice, meditation, exercise, and good-quality sleep.

Take gratitude. Our brains are overwhelmingly focused on the negative since we're trained to always look out for danger. The downside is that negativity leads to high stress levels. A daily practice of gratitude --⁠ just writing down ten things you're grateful for each day --⁠ trains your brain to pay more attention to the positive instead.

## Flow is the ultimate condition for achieving the impossible

## Flow - The state is characterized by complete focus on the present moment. Mood-boosting chemicals flood our brains, while stress hormones are flushed away. Productivity is amplified by up to 500 percent. Learning rates soar 230 percent

It's no wonder that flow makes us feel like we can achieve the impossible. So how do you get some flow for yourself? The process consists of four stages.

1. **Struggle -** Here, you're learning, taking in loads of new information, and feeling frustrated as a result.

2. **Release -** it's time to give your brain time to relax and let go by doing things like exercising, going for a walk, or engaging in a light hobby. During this time, your brain will be busy passing what you've learned into your long-term memory.

3. **Reward -** To get into flow, give yourself a large chunk of time with no external distractions to work on your project.

4. **Recovery -** Flow costs a lot of energy, and you've got to replenish it somehow. So have a healthy meal, get some good sleep, or take a long bath.

## Final summary

## Follow the 80/20 rule

When you're trying to master a skill, try the 80/20 approach popularized by the author and investor Tim Ferriss. The idea is that 80 percent of your results stem from 20 percent of your actions. Say you want to learn to play a new musical instrument. Most pop songs consist of just four or five chords, so mastering those chords alone can take you a long way. When you're trying to master a skill, be sure to focus on the 20 percent that really matters.

If I keep doing what I am about to do today for the next five years, will I end up with more of what I want or less of what I want?

"Too often, we fall into an all-or-nothing cycle with our habits.

The problem is not slipping up; the problem is thinking that if you can't do something perfectly, then you shouldn't do it at all."

Instead of feeling that you've blown the day and thinking, "I'll get back on track tomorrow," try thinking of each day as a set of four quarters: morning, midday, afternoon, evening. If you blow one quarter, you get back on track for the next quarter.

Fail small, not big.

"The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change:

What gets rewarded, gets repeated. What gets punished, gets avoided.

Don't reward behavior you don't want to see repeated."

"The bad days are more important than the good days.

If you write or exercise or meditate or cook when you don't feel like it, then you maintain the habit.

And if you maintain the habit, then all you need is time."

"You can usually accomplish more by giving something your full effort for a few years rather than giving it a lukewarm effort for fifty years.

Pick a priority for this season of your life and do it to the best of your ability."

"If you want a significant change in your results, then you probably need a significant change to your strategy. Working harder on your current strategy is unlikely to move the needle.

Before you work harder, work on the right thing.

Play better games. Win better prizes."

"Know what you want.

Follow a trajectory where what you want is a possible outcome.

Build a system to incrementally improve your ability to follow that trajectory.

Trust yourself.

Enjoy the outcomes.

Repeat."

There are hundreds of paths up the mountain, all leading in the same direction, so it doesn't matter which path you take. The only one wasting time is the one who runs around and around the mountain, telling everyone that his or her path is wrong.

"A brief guide to compounding:

If you don't enjoy something, you won't stick with it.

If you don't stick with it, it won't compound.

Being interested precedes the results.

## Blinkist - Chasing Excellence by Ben Bergero

Story about building the fittest athelete

Athletic excellence isn't an elusive condition that only exists in people with the right DNA or natural talent. Anyone can achieve this excellence, as long as they have the passion, commitment and willingness to grow in more than just physical strength. If you want to master a discipline, you must develop your mental fortitude and be willing to push yourself far beyond normal limits. Without this, you'll never reach the highest peaks.

Actionable advice:

Try to think of improvement as getting better by 1 percent every day.

This kind of incremental improvement is called "aggregation of marginal gains" -- because small but meaningful buildup is a powerful tool. By the end of the year, you can make 100 percent improvements!

- If it doesn't kill you, it makes you stronger.
- Passion
- Deliberate practice
- Excellence requires a balance between strict control and knowing what you can't control
- Double loop learning (considering internal + external factors)
- Being humble
- Feeling positive creates positive results
- Your thoughts become your words, your words become your actions, and your actions dictate your destiny.
- Intense training and training for worst situations
- Having **grit** allows to push through limitations and achieve competitive excellence

## Blinkist - Can't hurt me by David Goggins

- When you're thinking of quitting: accept the pain and refuse to quit as a possibility
- Push yourself daily to do what you don't want to do
- Week after week expand the limits of your comfort zone little by little
- Use enemies and hardships as fuel for your motivation
- Build your cookie jar of accomplishments and use that for motivation
- The best way to overcome anything in life is to become a master of what you're afraid of. Become a master of your insecurities.
- It's easy to stand out among people and be a big fish in small pond. It's much more difficult when you're a wolf, surrounded by wolves.
- Torch the complacency you feel gathering around you, continue to put obstacles in front of yourself because that's where you will find the friction that will help you grow even stronger.

## Blinkist - The Dip by Seth Godin (19 Mar 2019)

A little book that teaches you when to quit (and when to stick)

- To be a superstar, you must do something exceptional. Not just survive the Dip, but use the Dip as an opportunity to create something so extraordinary that people can't help but talk about it, recommend it, and, yes, choose it.
- The next time you catch yourself being average when you feel like quitting, realize that you have only two good choices: Quit or be exceptional. Average is for losers.
- Winners understand that taking that pain now prevents a lot more pain later. Winners quit all the time. They just quit the right stuff at the right time.
- The decision to quit or not is a simple evaluation: Is the pain of the Dip worth the benefit of the light at the end of the tunnel?
- Quitting as a short-term strategy is a bad idea. Quitting for the long term is an excellent idea because it frees you up to excel at something else.
- Quit the wrong stuff. Stick with the right stuff. Have the guts to do one or the other.
- At the beginning, when you first start something, it's fun.Over the next few days and weeks, the rapid learning you experience keeps you going. Whatever your new thing is, it's easy to stay engaged in it. And then the Dip happens. The Dip is the long slog between starting and mastery. A long slog that's actually a shortcut, because it gets you where you want to go faster than any other path.
- Knowing that you're facing a Dip is the first step in getting through it.
- Quitting when you hit the Dip is a bad idea. If the journey you started was worth doing, then quitting when you hit the Dip just wastes the time you've already invested. Quit in the Dip often enough and you'll find yourself becoming a serial quitter, starting many things but accomplishing little
- If you can't make it through the Dip, don't start.
- If you're not able to get through the Dip in an exceptional way, you must quit. And quit right now

You believe you control environment and whatever you do matters for your results
