The submodule has its own history; the repository it is embedded in is called a superproject.\n\n## Git Bisect\n\n`git-bisect` - Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug\n\n## git pull origin master from a different branch\n\nThis command directly fetch and merge the changes from origin to ECBC-master and than merges to the current branch. So we don't have to perform following steps-\n\n- git pull\n- git checkout master\n- git pull (For fast forwarding the branch)\n- git checkout form-validations\n- git merge master\n\n## Rebase\n\n<https://dev.to/gonedark/a-closer-look-at-git-rebase>\n\nRebasing is the process of modifying the base commit from which series of commits stem\n\n## Bringing a branch up to date\n\nFor some,git rebasefalls on themagicend of the spectrum for Git commands. Yet, if we break down the actions taken bygit rebasewe can understand the magic.\n\nWhile atreeis the goto analogy when visualizing Git commands, I findvideo editingalso helps describegit rebase.\n\nIn the case of bringing astalebranch up to date, let's consider the following tree progression.\n\n![image](../../media/Technologies-Git-Theory-image1.png)\n\nStarting with the full tree, we have astalebranch (in red) off amasterbranch. If we zoom in, we see the branch isstalebecause it's missing the recent commits frommaster(in blue).\n\nWhen we run git rebase, it first will rewind both branches back to the first point when their commit history matches (in gray). From this point, git rebase will fast-forward through the commits on the master branch and apply them to the stale branch. Finally, git rebase replays the commits from the stale branch.\n\nThe resulting tree is as if you just created a new branch offmasterand made your commits. In doing so,git rebasefacilitates a clean merge.\n\nJust remember to always git branch backupbefore you rebase. Then, after the rebase, you can git diff backup to make sure it went well. If something does go awry, you can just git reset --hard backup and start over.\n\n![git](../../media/Technologies-Git-Theory-image2.png)\n\n## .git folder\n\n```python\n.\n|-- COMMIT_EDITMSG\n|-- FETCH_HEAD\n|-- HEAD\n|-- ORIG_HEAD\n|-- branches\n|-- config\n|-- description\n|-- hooks\n| |-- applypatch-msg\n| |-- commit-msg\n| |-- post-commit\n| |-- post-receive\n| |-- post-update\n| |-- pre-applypatch\n| |-- pre-commit\n| |-- pre-rebase\n| |-- prepare-commit-msg\n| |-- update\n|-- index\n|-- info\n|  |-- exclude\n|-- logs\n| |-- HEAD\n| |-- refs\n|-- objects\n|-- refs\n    |-- heads\n    |-- remotes\n    |-- stash\n    |-- tags\n```\n\n<https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrepository-layout>\n\n## Git Merge Commit\n\ngit merge commit is used when two branches are added to master with interleaving commits. So doing git log shows all the commits in chronological order with different branches commit interleaved.\n\nDoing git reset on a merge commit will roll back all the commits of that merge commit which are interleaved between other branches commit.\n\nWhen there is no merge commit it's called **Fast Forward Merge.**\n\n[Fast forward merge](https://kolosek.com/git-merge/#fastforwardmerge) is a type of merge that doesn't create a commit, instead, it updates the branch pointer to the last commit.\n\n## Git is an event sourcing system\n\nEvent sourcing system have two components - current state of the systems and logs for the event that has happened. Replaying all the events from the logs can give any state of the system at any time.\n\nOther example of event sourcing system is accounting systems.\n\n## Git ignore already tracked files\n\n- `git update-index --skip-worktree`\n\n    `--skip-worktree` is the flag which means the files should change locally\n\n    That is, Use the command when you want to modify files managed by Git locally (or updated automatically) but you do not want Git to manage that change.\n\n    Because the command is to prevent local changes from being managed by Git,we will use the command in most cases.\n\n    ```bash\n    $ git update-index --skip-worktree path/to/file # Exclude from the management of Git\n\n    $ git ls-files -v | grep ^S # Confirming\n        git ls-files shows all files managed by git.\n        -v check the file being ignored.\n        --skip-worktree is displayed withS.\n\n    $ git update-index --no-skip-worktree path/to/file # Restore to the management of Git\n    ```\n\n- `git update-index --assume-unchanged`\n\n    `--assume-unchanged` is the flag which means the files should not change locally\n\n    In other words, it is used whenignore files that you do not need to change locally (or should not change).\n\n    --assume-unchangedis used when you want to speed up Git's behavior by ignoring unnecessary files.\n\n    Also, since it is an idea to ignore local changes,git reset - hardcommand will delete local changes.\n\n    ```bash\n    $ git update-index --assume-unchanged path/to/file #Exclude from the management of Git\n    $ git ls-files -v | grep ^h #Confirming\n        assume-unchanged is displayed with h\n\n    $ git update-index --no-assume-unchanged path/to/file #Restore to the management of Git\n    ```\n\n## gitattributes\n\nThe .gitattributes file allows you to specify the files and paths attributes that should be used by git when performing git actions, such asgit commit, etc.\n\nIn other words git automatically saves the file according to the attributes specified, every time a file is created or saved.\n\nOne of these attributes is the eol (end of line) and is used to configure the line endings for a file. This article will now dive deeper into how to configure the line endings, so every developer uses the same value when using different machines / OSes across the repository.\n\n## 7 Rules of great Git commit message\n\n1. [Separate subject from body with a blank line](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#separate)\n2. [Limit the subject line to 50 characters](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#limit-50)\n3. [Capitalize the subject line](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#capitalize)\n4. [Do not end the subject line with a period](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#end)\n5. [Use the imperative mood in the subject line](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#imperative)\n6. [Wrap the body at 72 characters](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#wrap-72)\n7. [Use the body to explainwhatandwhyvs.how](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#why-not-how)\n\n## References\n\n<https://kolosek.com/git-merge/#fastforwardmerge>\n\n<https://dev.to/neshaz/git-merge-vs-git-rebase-5134>\n\n<https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules>\n\n## Git Branches\n\nBranches in Git are incredibly lightweight as well. They are simply pointers to a specific commit -- nothing more. This is why many Git enthusiasts chant the mantra:\n\nbranch early, and branch often\n\nBecause there is no storage / memory overhead with making many branches, it's easier to logically divide up your work than have big beefy branches.\n\nWhen we start mixing branches and commits, we will see how these two features combine. For now though, just remember that a branch essentially says \"I want to include the work of this commit and all parent commits.\"\n\n```bash\ngit checkout -b bugFix\ngit branch -f three C2\ngit branch -f <branch_name> <where_to_move>\n```\n\n## Git Merging\n\nThe first method to combine work that we will examine isgit merge. Merging in Git creates a special commit that has two unique parents. A commit with two parents essentially means \"I want to include all the work from this parent over here and this one over here,andthe set of all their parents.\"\n\n1. **Checkout the branch where you want the commits to merge.**\n2. **Use command git merge <branch_name> from where you want commits to merge to the branch**\n\n```bash\ngit checkout -b bugFix\ngit commit\ngit checkout master\ngit commit\ngit merge bugFix\n```\n\n## Git Rebase\n\nThe second way of combining work between branches isrebasing.Rebasing essentially takes a set of commits, \"copies\" them, and plops them down somewhere else.\n\nWhile this sounds confusing, the advantage of rebasing is that it can be used to make a nice linear sequence of commits. The commit log / history of the repository will be a lot cleaner if only rebasing is allowed.\n\n```bash\ngit checkout -b bugFix\ngit commit\ngit checkout master\ngit commit\ngit checkout bugFix\ngit rebase master\n```\n\n## Forwarding the branch\n\n```bash\ngit rebase master bugFix\ngit rebase <changes_where_to_add> <changes_from_where_to_add>\n```\n\n## Git interactive rebase\n\nAll interactive rebase means is using therebasecommand with the-ioption.\n\nIf you include this option, git will open up a UI to show you which commits are about to be copied below the target of the rebase. It also shows their commit hashes and messages, which is great for getting a bearing on what's what.\n\nWhen the interactive rebase dialog opens, you have the ability to do 3 things:\n\n- Reorder commit\n- Omit commits\n- Squash commits\n\n`git rebase <branch-name> -i`\n\n## Moving around in Git\n\n1. **HEAD**\n\nHEAD is the symbolic name for the currently checked out commit -- it's essentially what commit you're working on top of.\n\nHEAD always points to the most recent commit which is reflected in the working tree. Most git commands which make changes to the working tree will start by changing HEAD.\n\n## Detaching HEAD\n\nDetaching HEAD just means attaching it to a commit instead of a branch.\n\n2. **Relative Refs**\n    - Moving upwards one commit at a time with `^` (Caret Operator)\n    - Moving upwards a number of times with `~num`\n\n```bash\ngit checkout bugFix^ (parent of bugFix)\ngit checkout HEAD^ (parent of current HEAD)\ngit checkout HEAD~4\n```\n\n## Branch Forcing\n\nYou can directly reassign a branch to a commit with the-foption.\n\n`git branch -f master HEAD~3` (moves (by force) the master branch to three parents behind HEAD.)\n\n## Reversing Changes in Git\n\nAnd just like committing, reversing changes in Git has both a low-level component (staging individual files or chunks) and a high-level component (how the changes are actually reversed). Our application will focus on the latter.\n\nThere are two primary ways to undo changes in Git -- one is using git resetand the other is using git revert. We will look at each of these in the next dialog\n\n### Git Reset\n\ngit resetreverts changes by moving a branch reference backwards in time to an older commit. In this sense you can think of it as \"rewriting history;\"git resetwill move a branch backwards as if the commit had never been made in the first place.\n\n`git reset HEAD~1`\n\n### Git Revert\n\nWhile reseting works great for local branches on your own machine, its method of \"rewriting history\" doesn't work for remote branches that others are using.\n\nIn order to reverse changes andshare those reversed changes with others, we need to usegit revert. Let's see it in action\n\n`git revert HEAD`\n\nWeird, a new commit plopped down below the commit we wanted to reverse. That's because this new commit C2 ' introduces changes -- it just happens to introduce changes that exactly reverses the commit of C2.\n\nWith reverting, you can push out your changes to share with others.\n\n## Cherry Pick\n\n`git cherry-pick <Commit1> <Commit2> <...>`\n\nIt's a very straightforward way of saying that you would like to copy a series of commits below your current location (HEAD).\n\n## Locally stacked commits\n\n### Problem\n\nHere's a development situation that often happens: I'm trying to track down a bug but it is quite elusive. In order to aid in my detective work, I put in a few debug commands and a few print statements.\n\nAll of these debugging / print statements are in their own commits. Finally I track down the bug, fix it, and rejoice!\n\nOnly problem is that I now need to get mybugFixback into themasterbranch. If I simply fast-forwardedmaster, thenmasterwould get all my debug statements which is undesirable. There has to be another way...\n\n```bash\ngit checkout master\ngit cherry-pick bugFix\n\nOr\n\ngit rebase master -i\ngit rebase -i overHere\n```\n\n## Juggling commits\n\nHere's another situation that happens quite commonly. You have some changes (newImage) and another set of changes (caption) that are related, so they are stacked on top of each other in your repository (aka one after another).\n\nThe tricky thing is that sometimes you need to make a small modification to an earlier commit. In this case, design wants us to change the dimensions ofnewImageslightly, even though that commit is way back in our history!!\n\nWe will overcome this difficulty by doing the following:\n\n- We will re-order the commits so the one we want to change is on top withgit rebase -i\n- We willcommit --amendto make the slight modification\n- Then we will re-order the commits back to how they were previously withgit rebase -i\n- Finally, we will move master to this updated part of the tree to finish the level (via the method of your choosing)\n\n```bash\ngit rebase -i master\ngit commit --amend\ngit rebase -i master\ngit checkout master\ngit merge C3\n# Or\ngit rebase caption master\n\n# Using Cherry-pick\ngit checkout master\ngit cherry-pick C2\ngit commit --amend\ngit cherry-pick C3\n```\n\n## Git Tags\n\n```bash\ngit tag v1 C1\ngit tag v2 C2\n```\n\n## Git Describe\n\nGit describe can help you get your bearings after you've moved many commits backwards or forwards in history; this can happen after you've completed a git bisect (a debugging search) or when sitting down at a coworkers computer who just got back from vacation.\n\ngit has a command todescribewhere you are relative to the closest \"anchor\" (aka tag).\n\n`git describe <ref>`\n\nWhere `<ref>` is anything git can resolve into a commit. If you don't specify a ref, git just uses where you're checked out right now (HEAD).\n\nThe output of the command looks like:\n\n`<tag>_<numCommits>_g<hash>`\n\nWhere tag is the closest ancestor tag in history, num Commits is how many commits away that tag is, and `<hash>` is the hash of the commit being described.\n\n## Specifying Parents in merge commit (Using Modifiers)\n\nLike the `~` modifier, the `^` modifier also accepts an optional number after it.\n\nRather than specifying the number of generations to go back (what `~` takes), the modifier on `^` specifies which parent reference to follow from a merge commit. Remember that merge commits have multiple parents, so the path to choose is ambiguous.\n\nGit will normally follow the \"first\" parent upwards from a merge commit, but specifying a number with^changes this default behavior.\n\n`git checkout master^`\n\n![image](../../media/Technologies-Git-Theory-image3.png)\n\n`git checkout master^2`\n\n![image](../../media/Technologies-Git-Theory-image4.png)\n\n![image](../../media/Technologies-Git-Theory-image5.png)\n\n![image](../../media/Technologies-Git-Theory-image6.png)\n\nCreating Branch\n\n`git branch bugWork HEAD~^2~`\n\n## Remote Commands\n\n1. **Git clone**\n\n2. **Git fetch**\n\ngit fetchperforms two main steps, and two main steps only. It:\n\n- downloads the commits that the remote has but are missing from our local repository, and...\n- updates where our remote branches point (for instance,o/master)\n\ngit fetchessentially brings ourlocalrepresentation of the remote repository into synchronization with what theactualremote repository looks like (right now).\n\n3. **Git pull**\n\n4. **Git push**\n\n## Diverged history\n\n![image](../../media/Technologies-Git-Theory-image7.png)\n\n## Git pull --rebase; git push\n\n## Feature Branches Push and Pull\n\n![image](../../media/Technologies-Git-Theory-image8.png)\n\n## Remote Tracking\n\nAnother way to set remote tracking on a branch is to simply use thegit branch -uoption. Running\n\n`git branch -u o/master foo`\n\nwill set the foo branch to track o/master. Iffoois currently checked out you can even leave it off: `git branch -u o/master`\n\n`git checkout -b side o/master`\n\n## Colon refspec\n\n![image](../../media/Technologies-Git-Theory-image9.png)\n\n`git push origin <source>:<destination>`\n\n<https://learngitbranching.js.org>\n\n<https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-for-professionals>\n","excerpt":"Theory Created: 2017-10-03 21:33:41 +0500 Modified: 2021-10-05 16:19:48 +0500 Submodule Mounting one repository inside another.
