The most common HTTPD servers are Apache or nginx for Linux and IIS for Windows\n\n## Web Server\n\nA request comes in and arrives at the first component - a dedicatedweb server. It is great at reading static files from disk (your css files for example) and handling multiple requests. When a request is not a static file, but meant for your all it gets passed on down the stack.\n\nExamples\n\n1. Nginx\n\n2. Cherokee\n\n3. Apache HTTP Server\n\n4. Apache Tomcat\n\n5. IIS\n\n## Application Server\n\nTheapplication servergets those fancy requests and converts the information from them into Python objects which are usable by frameworks. How this is supposed to happen is described by a specification people agreed on -[WSGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface). (*whiskey*)\n\nExamples\n\n1.

They can be a self-contained hardware appliance or installable software.\n\nWeb accelerators may be installed on the client computer or mobile device, on ISP servers, on the server computer/network, or a combination. Accelerating delivery through compression requires some type of host-based server to collect, compress and then deliver content to a client computer.\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accelerator>\n\n## Microsoft IIS (Internet Information Services)\n\n## Python Application Servers\n\n- [Bjoern](https://github.com/jonashaag/bjoern) describes itself as a \"screamingly fast Python WSGI server\" and boasts that is \"the fastest, smallest and most lightweight WSGI server.\" We created [a small application](https://gist.github.com/omedhabib/c3c8ff74ec3993740e80d7235251e73a), using most of the library's defaults.\n- [CherryPy](http://cherrypy.org/) is an extremely popular and stable WSGI framework and server.\n- [Gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/) was inspired by Ruby's Unicorn server (hence the name). It modestly claims that it is \"simply implemented, light on server resources, and fairly speedy.\" Unlike Bjoern and CerryPy, Gunicorn is a standalone server. \"WORKER_COUNT\" was set to be twice the number of available of processors, plus one. This was based on a recommendation from Gunicorn's documentation.\n- [Meinheld](http://meinheld.org/) is a \"high-performance WSGI-compliant web server\" that claims to be lightweight. Based on the example listed on its website, we constructed [this application](https://gist.github.com/omedhabib/d638e213af0f843580e5ca7724005ac6).\n- [mod_wsgi](http://www.modwsgi.org/) is authored by the same creator as mod_python. Like mod_python, it is only available for Apache. However, it includes a tool called \"mod_wsgi express\" that transparently configures a minimal instance of Apache. we configured and used mod_wsgi-express [with this command](https://gist.github.com/omedhabib/8f0e6f7d0103780d3f6f0f73108a86b2). To be consistent with Gunicorn (and in lieu of any official recommendation), we configured mod_wsgi to create twice as many workers as there are processors.\n- [uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is a fully-featured application server. Generally, uWSGI is paired with a reverse proxy (such as Nginx).\n\n## uWSGI\n\nuWSGIis a [software application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_application) that \"aims at developing a full stack for building [hosting services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosting_services)\".It is named after the [Web Server Gateway Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface)(WSGI), which was the first plugin supported by the project.\n\nuWSGI is often used for serving [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))[web applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_applications) in conjunction with [web servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server) such as [Cherokee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee_(web_server)) and [Nginx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx), which offer direct support for uWSGI's native uwsgi protocol.\n\nThe uWSGI project aims at developing a full stack for building hosting services.\n\nApplication servers (for various programming languages and protocols), proxies, process managers and monitors are all implemented using a common api and a common configuration style.\n\nThanks to its pluggable architecture it can be extended to support more platforms and languages.\n\nCurrently, you can write plugins in C, C++ and Objective-C.\n\nThe \"WSGI\" part in the name is a tribute to the namesake Python standard, as it has been the first developed plugin for the project.\n\nVersatility, performance, low-resource usage and reliability are the strengths of the project (and the only rules followed).\n\n<https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest>\n\n## WSGI (whiz-gee with a hard 'g' or 'whiskey')\n\nWeb Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) is a simple calling convention for web servers to forward request to web applications or frameworks written in Python Programming Language.\n\nThe WSGI has two sides:\n\n- the server/gateway side - This is often a full web server as Apache or Nginx, or a lightweight application server that can communicate with a webserver, such as flup\n- the application/framework side - This is a Python callable, supplied by the Python program or framework\n\nBetween the server and the application, there may be one or more WSGI middleware components, which implement both side of the API\n\n## Why WSGI\n\n- WSGI servers are designed to handle many requests concurrently. Frameworks are not made to process thousands of requests and determine how to best route them from the server.\n- WSGI speeds up Python web application development because you only need to know basic things about WSGI. If you use TurboGears, Django or CherryPy, you do not need to be concerned about how your particular framework utilizes the WSGI standard. However, you will benefit by understanding how WSGI is implemented.\n- WSGI gives you the [flexibility of changing](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/#rationale-and-goals) web stack components for alternatives without changing the application that runs with WSGI.\n\n## ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface)\n\nASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is a spiritual successor to WSGI, intended to provide a standard interface between async-capable Python web servers, frameworks, and applications.\n\nWhere WSGI provided a standard for synchronous Python apps, ASGI provides one for both asynchronous and synchronous apps, with a WSGI backwards-compatibility implementation and multiple servers and application frameworks.\n\n## How does ASGI work?\n\nASGI is structured as a single, asynchronous callable. It takesscope, which contains details about the incoming request, send, an awaitable that lets you send events to the client, andreceive, an awaitable which lets you receive events from the client.\n\nThis not only allows multiple incoming events and outgoing events for each application, but also allows for a background coroutine so the application can do other things (such as listening for events on an external trigger, like a Redis queue).\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe WSGI specification has worked well since it was introduced, and allowed for great flexibility in Python framework and web server choice. However, its design is irrevocably tied to the HTTP-style request/response cycle, and more and more protocols that do not follow this pattern are becoming a standard part of web programming (most notably, WebSocket).\n\nASGI attempts to preserve a simple application interface, while providing an abstraction that allows for data to be sent and received at any time, and from different application threads or processes.\n\nIt also takes the principle of turning protocols into Python-compatible, asynchronous-friendly sets of messages and generalises it into two parts; a standardised interface for communication around which to build servers (this document), and a set of standard message formats for each protocol.\n\nIts primary goal is to provide a way to write HTTP/2 and WebSocket code alongside normal HTTP handling code, however; part of this design means ensuring there is an easy path to use both existing WSGI servers and applications, as a large majority of Python web usage relies on WSGI and providing an easy path forward is critical to adoption. Details on that interoperability are covered in the ASGI-HTTP spec.\n\n## Overview\n\nASGI consists of two different components:\n\n- **Aprotocol server**, which terminates sockets and translates them into connections and per-connection event messages.\n- **Anapplication**, which lives inside aprotocol server, is instantiated once per connection, and handles event messages as they happen.\n\nLike WSGI, the server hosts the application inside it, and dispatches incoming requests to it in a standardized format. Unlike WSGI, however, applications are instantiated objects that are fed events rather than simple callables, and must run asasyncio-compatible coroutines (on the main thread; they are free to use threading or other processes if they need synchronous code).\n\nUnlike WSGI, there are two separate parts to an ASGI connection:\n\n- Aconnection scope, which represents a protocol connection to a user and survives until the connection closes.\n- Events, which are sent to the application as things happen on the connection.\n\nApplications are instantiated with a connection scope, and then run in an event loop where they are expected to handle events and send data back to the client.\n\nEach application instance maps to a single incoming \"socket\" or connection, and is expected to last the lifetime of that connection plus a little longer if there is cleanup to do. Some protocols may not use traditional sockets; ASGI specifications for those protocols are expected to define what the scope (instance) lifetime is and when it gets shut down.\n\n<https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html>\n\n<https://www.appdynamics.com/blog/engineering/an-introduction-to-python-wsgi-servers-part-1>\n\n## Apache vs Nginx\n\nIt is important to clarify that only when you have large daily web traffic, you should be concerned about the performance of a web server. In case you have light daily web traffic, the performance of either of the web servers will not be affected. Furthermore, adding PHP-FPM to both the web server will not make a relative difference even though the actual performance will get enhanced in both cases. It is said that PHP-FPM has a better enhancement effect on Apache web server than Nginx. It is also said that Nginx is faster than Apache in most of the cases. Actually, there are two factors that determine the performance of the web servers for any given web application.\n\n## Content Type\n\nThere are basically two types of contents applicable in the web application. One is static content that stays the same throughout the lifetime of the website session and then there is dynamic content that keeps on changing based on various triggers. The performance of the web servers varies a lot based on this content type.\n\nApache uses the traditional file-based methods to handle static content. This traditional method is slightly old-fashioned and that is why it has slightly low performance if you consider today's high standard of dealing with static content. On the other hand, Apache web servers give more important to dynamic content and it processes them by an embedded processor. The dynamic contents are executed with the web server and there is no need for external components. It is this ability to handle dynamic content internally that makes Apache the best performing web servers for web applications having more dynamic content.\n\nComing to Nginx, Nginx lacks the ability to handle dynamic content internally. It uses an external processor for such execution and there is going to be a waiting period for sending requests to external processors and getting responses which slow down the performance significantly. Configuring the communication between Nginx and external processor can also get complicated at times especially when there are too many web traffics on the application. It is somewhat a benefit in disguise. This enables Nginx to handle static content at a faster rate internally.\n\nVerdict -- If you have a web application that has more dynamic content, go for Apache. If the static content is more, Nginx is the best option.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe reason why Apache is considered to be slower than Nginx in most of the cases is its repetitive configuration. Apache checks .htaccess file resides within the content directories. This helps in decentralized configuration but processing requests take a lot more time than it is the case with Nginx. Interpreting .htacceess file each time it is found on the request path is an old concept. This is more useful in content management systems or in shared hosting to allow non-privileged users to control certain aspects without full control over configuration file. Nginx, on the other hand, checks .htaccess files only on the parent directories and hence, the requests can be served faster.\n\nVerdict -- Unless you have a website or web application where you need to give non-privilege users certain controls, you should always go for Nginx otherwise.\n\n<https://www.freelancinggig.com/blog/2018/04/25/apache-php-fpm-vs-nginx-php-fpm-performance-considerations>\n\n## File vs URI-Based Interpretation\n\nHow the web server interprets requests and maps them to actual resources on the system is another area where these two servers differ.\n\n## Apache\n\nApache provides the ability to interpret a request as a physical resource on the filesystem or as a URI location that may need a more abstract evaluation. In general, for the former Apache uses `<Directory>` or `<Files>` blocks, while it utilizes `<Location>` blocks for more abstract resources.\n\nBecause Apache was designed from the ground up as a web server, the default is usually to interpret requests as filesystem resources. It begins by taking the document root and appending the portion of the request following the host and port number to try to find an actual file. Basically, the filesystem hierarchy is represented on the web as the available document tree.\n\nApache provides a number of alternatives for when the request does not match the underlying filesystem. For instance, anAliasdirective can be used to map to an alternative location. Using `<Location>` blocks is a method of working with the URI itself instead of the filesystem. There are also regular expression variants which can be used to apply configuration more flexibly throughout the filesystem.\n\nWhile Apache has the ability to operate on both the underlying filesystem and the webspace, it leans heavily towards filesystem methods.
