The smallest bus factor is 1. Larger numbers are preferable. Essentially, a low bus factor represents a single point of failure within the team.\n\n<https://deviq.com/bus-factor>\n\nEscalation matrix\n\n## One Minute Manager\n\n![image](media/People-Team-Management-Culture-image12.png)\n\n[**https://klinger.io/posts/managing-people-%F0%9F%A4%AF**](https://klinger.io/posts/managing-people-%F0%9F%A4%AF)\n\n- There is no point being angry at your team -- ever\n- You are in charge of processes and people\n  - And you got more information than they do, always\n- You either created the processes where this outcome happened\n  - or you hired (or did not fire) the wrong people\n- Ultimately everything is your fault\n\n## Feedbacks\n\n- What would you say is my biggest strength?\n\nThis is a question that I love asking my manager and peers because I experience imposter syndrome a lot more than I'd like to admit. Asking this question tackles two things: getting feedback from those around me and squashing feelings of imposter syndrome as they creep up.\n\n## Word Cloud\n\n- Integrity\n- Fairness\n- Transparency\n- Move up / out\n- Fail fast, Fail often\n- Take ownership\n- Excecute well, Execute quickly\n- Process Orientation\n- Customer centricity\n- Innovate\n- Obligation to Dissent\n- Focus on product\n- Attention to detail\n- Communicate well & Clearly\n\n![image](media/People-Team-Management-Culture-image13.png)\n\n## Remote Working / Teams\n\n- **TODOs**\n  - Creating remote teams once a month/quarter meetups\n  - Daily stand-up\n  - Evening syncups\n  - Fixed set of tasks\n  - Everything should be written down and organized\n- **Benefits**\n  - Hiring firing is easy\n- Transfer operational knowledge\n- Over paid vs under paid\n- Really need good managers to take over team\n- Creating feedback loop for every process\n\n## Remote working tips\n\n1. Default to action (if remote and waiting for someone respond, then default to action, take a decision and move on)\n\n\"As far as life philosophies go, \"The right time is right now\" isn't a bad one. Most of us would benefit from a greater bias toward action.\n\nIf you move fast, you can try more things. And if you try more things, you're likely to find something that works for you.\"\n\n2. Over-communicate where possible\n\n3. Make yourself available\n\n4. Prioritize face-to-face conversations\n\n5. Offer space to de-stress\n\n6. Share strategies to help your local community\n\n## Distributed Team (Trust) - Values (Gitlab) (CREDIT)\n\n- Collaboration\n- Results\n- Efficiency\n- Diversity & Inclusion\n- Iteration\n- Transparency - Record by default\n  - Record everything, cannot afford to train people in meetings\n  - self-paced learning and discovery\n  - send links to avoid wasting valuable time holding meetings or getting interrupted by same questions\n  - access the best version of the information\n\nTo complement the self-assessment of the stress continuum, McGladrey recently piloted a system she calls **\"3-3-3\"** --- basically an informal **check-in three days, three weeks, and three months** after a significant event. At the three-day mark, the idea is to gauge the mental state of participants at the time of the event and identify some red flags for bad outcomes. These check-ins can also identify people who need more support.\"\n\n[Debbie Lovich: 3 tips for leaders to get the future of work right | TED](https://youtu.be/kTS1jJgXsfw)\n\n<https://blog.trello.com/boundaries-to-start-setting-with-your-team>\n\n<https://blog.trello.com/conflict-management-strategies-for-hybrid-teams>\n\n## Deadlines\n\n<https://irrationallabs.com/blog/papers-were-reading-week-17>\n\n## Learning and Development Officer (CLO - Chief Learning Officer)\n\n<https://360learning.com/blog/6-key-skills-chief-learning-officer>\n\n<https://360learning.com/blog/lifelong-learning>\n\n## TEAM MANAGEMENT (Collaboration, Motivation, Solving Problems, Conflict Resolution, Likeability)\n\n| **S No** | **Self Remarks**    | **Self Rating** |\n|----------|---------------------|-----------------|\n| 1        | Collaboration       | Rating - 3/5    |\n| 2        | Motivation          | Rating - 4/5    |\n| 3        | Solving Problems    | Rating - 4/5    |\n| 4        | Conflict Resolution | Rating - 3/5    |\n| 5        | Likeability         | Rating - 3/5    |\n\n## QRC Team Topologies\n\n![image](media/People-Team-Management-Culture-image14.jpeg)\n\n## Managing Managers\n\n## Do\n\n- Treat your direct reports in the same way you want them to treat their team members.\n- Look for opportunities to observe them in action.\n- Spend time getting to know their team members.\n\n## Don't\n\n- Dictate exactly how they should manage. Instead, give them advice and let them find their own authentic style.\n- Criticize them in front of their team. You should be looking for opportunities to bolster their credibility.\n- Wait until the annual review cycle to ask for input. Regularly seek feedback on how you're doing as their manager.\n\n<https://hbr.org/2016/08/how-to-manage-managers>\n\n<https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/people-managers/pages/managing-managers.aspx>\n\n<https://www.managementcenter.org/resources/tips-managing-managers>\n\n1. Cultivate and affirm ownership\n\n2. Understand their management and leadership style\n\n3. Always be modeling\n\n4. See them in action\n\n5. See the work in action, too\n\n6. Build relationships with your managers' teams\n\n<https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/378072>\n\n1. Help them go from manager to leader\n\n2. Give managers a budget\n\n3. Empower and encourage managers to take care of their top performersin terms of needs, pay and recognition\n\n4. Respect their position as manager and allow them to task their teams and set deliverables\n\n5. Ensure they know how you want to be kept informed\n\n6. Create trust so managers can come to you for help when they need a sounding board\n\n7. Make sure they can tell the difference between a people issue and simply being misaligned\n\n## Negative Connotation\n\nI have been observing interactions between you & my team.\n\nMy understanding is that you agreed to do a project, deliverables were clear & they were not met. Even the first milestone was not achieved by you, no question of it being close to agreed timelines.\n\nThe code you committed did not work in simple dev tests, so the question of it being of any use to us is absurd.\n\nWhat is the escalation about? My suggestion is we close the topic here, we have no interestin using anythingthat you have written, simplybecause it is not usable at all so its totally worthless.\n\nIf you wish to take this forward & threaten my team in any way then we will be forced to defend with all tools available to us.\n\nI hope your intention is not to threaten or escalate this matter & it is an error in my interpretation. If so please excuse me.\n\nPlease note thatwe can't take threats of legal action lightly so hopefully you see sense in this and retract that claim.\n\nAnger\n\nFear\n\nGreed\n\nJealousy\n\nUncertainty\n\n<https://ideas.ted.com/3-things-that-keep-people-feeling-motivated-at-work>\n\n- Self-determination theory essentially argued that people are motivated when they can determine for themselves what to work on and how to work on it.\n- Indeed they posit that incentives can drive down motivation --\"because incentives take away a sense of power to determine the work for oneself.\"\n\n1. The first motivational driver is **autonomy**. Autonomy refers to how much people feel in control of their own life and able to make their own choices. In the context of work, autonomy means people feel they have a say in what they work on and how they work on it. They don't feel micromanaged; they feel empowered by their managers to pursue objectives and deadlines on their terms.\n\n...One easy way to judge whether you are leading from a place of autonomy versus control is to pay attention to your feedback or coaching conversations with the team. Specifically, do this: Pay attention to how many times you're giving them advice vs. asking them questions. If you're often giving advice or telling people how to do something, you could be diminishing their sense of autonomy. But if you are asking questions designed to guide them to finding their own solutions, then you are leaving them in control.\n\n2. The second motivational driver is **competence**. Competence refers to our desires to seek control but also to experience mastery. Competence speaks to our natural human desire to be learners, to be growing and feeling like we're making progress. It could be progress in our career, progress towards a set of objectives or working for a team or a company that is making progress. Anything that helps individuals feel they are moving toward mastery leverages competence as a motivation.\n\n...make sure that even when you are giving people constructive feedback, you are pairing it with a lot of positive feedback and praise as well. That way it reminds them of the progress they've already made - and show them you're trying to help them make even more progress.\n\n3. The third and final motivational driver is **relatedness**. Relatedness refers to our will to connect with others, interact and care for other people. In terms of research, we've only just begun to grasp just how important relatedness to others truly is. But we know that humans are much more motivated to take actions when they're seen as pro-social - that is, when they're seen as being able to help other people.\n\n...if you can ensure the members of your team know who exactly is being helped by their efforts, you can almost guarantee they'll be willing to work hard to help those people.\n\n## There are two types of managers\n\n\"One who manages with fear, the other with motivation.\"\n\n\"In fact, 95% of people use fear management- tell people they're doing things wrong, demotivate them, show they didn't live up to expectations.\"\n\n\"Both styles work well.\"\n\n\"But they also forget one important thing.\"\n\n\"At the end of the day, people garner hatred for a person that manages with fear. When there's no respect, no connection, even though the business might do well in the short run, things will start falling apart slowly.\"\n\n\"What nobody taught us, is the other path.\"\n\n\"It's difficult because it comes with the possibility of people becoming lax and satisfied.\"\n\n\"But the manager who makes himself/herself vulnerable- who guides, nurtures, supports, respects--they're the people whom others look up to.\"\n\n\"No organization in the world is built on a product. It's built on people.\"\n","excerpt":"People / Team Management / Culture Created: 2020-07-03 13:56:44 +0500 Modified: 2022-12-09 23:57:21 +0500 I am available anytime, I can
