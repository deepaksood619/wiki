This can lead to hardship for the 2nd child. This is a complex subject and some vision on your part is necessary.\n\n- Estate Planning\n- Living Will\n\n## Choosing Stocks\n\n## PE less than 15\n\n- Fundamental Analysis\n  - Annual report\n  - Management discussions\n  - Audit report\n  - Important ratio\n  - Industry analysis\n- Valuation (Undervalued vs Overvalued)\n  - Price to sales\n  - PE\n  - PV / EBITDA\n- Technical Analysis\n  - MACD\n  - RSI\n  - Bollinger Bands\n\n## Benjamin Graham's Stock Screener\n\n- PE ratio < Inverse of yield on AAA corporate bonds\n- PE ratio < 40% of average PE ratio over the last 5 years\n- Divident yield > 2/3rd of AAA corporate bond yield\n- Price < 2/3rd of book value\n- Price < 2/3rd of net current assets\n- Debt equity ratio < 1\n- Current assets > 2x current liabilities\n- Debt < 2x net current assets\n- 10Y historical EPS growth > 7%\n- No more than 2 years of negative earnings in last 10 years\n\n## Warren Buffett's Principles\n\nBusiness\n\n- Simple and understandable\n- Consistent & predictable operating history\n- Favourable long term prospects\n- Presence of economic moat\n\nManagement\n\n- Candid and honest managers\n- Leaders and not followers\n\nFinancial\n\n- High return on equity\n- Strong owner's earnings\n- High and stable profit margin\n- Advocated use of discounted cash flow\n\nMarket\n\n- Use conservative estimates of earnings\n- Greed and fear amongst investors\n\n## Keep in mind\n\n## Things to keep in mind\n\n- Risk and Return go hand in hand. Higher the risk, higher the return. Lower the risk, lower is the return.\n- Investment in fixed income is a good option if you want to protect your principal amount. It is relatively less risky. However, you have the risk of losing money when you adjust the return for inflation. Example -- A fixed deposit which gives you 9% when the inflation is 10% means you are losing a net 1% per annum. Fixed-income investment is best suited for ultra risk-averse investors\n- Investment in Equities is a great option. It is known to beat inflation over a long period of time. Historically equity investment has generated returns close to 14-15%. However, equity investments can be risky\n- Real Estate investment requires a large outlay of cash and cannot be done with smaller amounts. Liquidity is another issue with real estate investment -- you cannot buy or sell whenever you want. You always have to wait for the right time and the right buyer or seller to transact with you.\n- Gold and silver are known to be a relatively safer but the historical return on such investment has not been very encouraging.\n\n## Buy strength and sell weakness\n\nStrength is represented by a bullish (blue) candle and weakness by a bearish (red) candle. Hence whenever you are buying ensure it is a blue candle day and whenever you are selling, ensure it's a red candle day.\n\n## Be flexible with patterns (quantify and verify)\n\nWhile the text book definition of a pattern could state a certain criteria, there could be minor variations to the pattern owing to market conditions. So one needs to be a bit flexible. However one needs to be flexible within limits, and hence it is required to always quantify the flexibility.\n\n## Look for a prior trend\n\nIf you are looking at a bullish pattern, the prior trend should be bearish and likewise if you are looking for a bearish pattern, the prior trend should be bullish.\n\n## What youngsters are doing\n\n- **Put money in experiences (strong)**\n  - Adventure activities / outdoor activities\n  - **Foreign trips (traveling)**\n- **Buy gadgets**\n  - **Apple (iphone), airpods (status symbol) (bigger status than houses)**\n- **Wifi internet is a must**\n  - Jio / Airtel\n- **FMCG**\n  - snacks / maggi / pasta (ready to eat) more than dal/rice/staples\n- Don't believe in buying flats/homes (strong)\n- Buy/rent car (strong)\n  - **uber/ola**\n  - Buy bikes (weak)\n- Invest in education (go for abroad studies take education loan)\n- Don't buy gold/jewellry\n- Buy fashionable clothes\n- Netflix / tiktok / instagram / facebook / games (pubg)\n  - mobile gaming more than pc or xbox and other gaming\n- Healthy foods / yoga / gym\n- **Don't cook a lot (order food from outside) (strong)**\n  - Zomato / swiggy / grofers / amazon / flipkart\n- Rent stuff more than buy (fridges/ac/washing machine)\n- coworking / coliving\n- Education for children\n  - **daycare**\n  - preschool\n  - nursery\n  - coaching\n\nMarkets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent -- John Maynard Keynes\n\nTwo basic rules when trading: (1) if you don't bet, you can't win. (2) if you lose all your chips, you can't bet -- Larry Hite\n\n\"When companies increase the number of job postings on their websites, we anticipate an increase in sales and earnings in the future,\" says Alex Nekrasov, an assistant professor of accounting at the University of Illinois at Chicago. \"When they cut them, it means some not-so-good times are likely ahead, probably sales and earnings will decline.\"\n\n## There are three principles of intelligent investing\n\n- An intelligent investor always analyzes the long-term evolution and management policies of a company before investing.\n- An intelligent investor always protects themselves from losses by diversifying investments.\n- An intelligent investor never looks for crazy returns but focuses on safe and steady profit.\n\n## Checklist\n\n- The stock should form a recognizable candlestick pattern\n- S&R should confirm the trade. The stoploss price should be around S&R\n  - For a long trade, the low of the pattern should be around the support\n  - For a short trade, the high of the pattern should be around the resistance\n- Volumes should confirm to the trade\n  - Presence of above average volumes on both buy and sell day\n  - Low volumes are not encouraging and hence do feel free to hesitate taking a trade where the volumes are low\n- Look at the trade from the Dow Theory perspective.\n  - Primary, secondary trends\n  - Double, triple, range formations\n  - Recognisable Dow formation\n- Indicators should confirm\n  - Scale the size higher if the confirm\n  - If they don't confirm, go ahead with the original plan\n- RRR should be satisfactory\n  - Think about your risk appetite and identify your RRR threshold\n  - For a complete beginner, I would suggest the RRR to be as high as possible as this provides a margin of safety\n  - For an active trader, I would suggest a RRR of at least 1.5\n\nNow, hypothetically imagine a situation where you are looking at opportunity to buy shares of Karnataka Bank Limited. On a particular day, Karnataka Bank has formed a bullish hammer, assume everything ticks on the checklist:\n\n- Bullish hammer is a recognizable candlestick pattern\n- The low of the bullish hammer also coincides with the support\n- The volumes are above average\n- There is also an MACD crossover (signal line turns greater than the MACD line)\n\nWith all four checklist points being ticked off I would be very glad to buy Karnataka Bank. Hence I place an order to buy, let us say for 500 shares.\n\nHowever, imagine a situation where the first 3 checklist conditions are met but the 4th condition (indicators should confirm) is not satisfied. What do you think I should do?\n\nI would still go ahead and buy, but instead of 500 shares, I'd probably buy 300 shares.\n\nThis should hopefully convey to you how I tend to (and advocate) the use of indicators.\n\nWhen Indicators confirm, I increase my bet size, but when Indicators don't confirm I still go ahead with my decision to buy, but I scale down my bet size.\n\nHowever I would not do this with the first three checklist points. For example, if the low of the bullish hammer does not coincide in and around the support, then I'll really reconsider my plan to buy the stock; in fact I may skip the opportunity, and look for another opportunity.\n\nBut I do not treat the indicators with the same conviction. It is always good to know what indicators convey, but I don't base my decisions on that. If the indicators confirm, I increase the bet size, if they don't, I still go ahead with my original game plan.\n\nWhen you identify a trading opportunity, always look how the trade is positioned from the Dow Theory perspective. For example if you are considering a long trade based on candlesticks, then look at what the primary and secondary trend is suggesting. If the primary trend is bullish, then it would be a good sign, however if we are in the secondary trend (which is counter to the primary) then you may want to think twice as the immediate trend is counter to the long trade.\n\n## Tools\n\n- Annual report of the company\n- Industry related data\n- Access to news\n- MS Excel\n\n## Blinkist - How to Make Money in Stocks by William J. O'Neil\n\n- You should learn stock chart patterns, and one pattern especially\n  - One of the most important to remember looks like a cup with a handle. In fact, that's its name:Cup with Handle. So, after rising for a period of time, a stock will often fall. As it falls, it sometimes makes a rounded, downward curve, which then becomes a steady, flat line. This is the base of the \"cup.\"\n  - This base is very important. Because, without a strong base of investors who believe in the stock, it could just collapse. But with this solid foundation, the stock will rise properly when its fortunes change. As it climbs upward, it will form the other side of the cup. Just then, it dips back again, and it will form the \"handle.\" It's precisely atthatpoint that you should buy in. More times than not, the stock will shoot upward.\n  - Whether the stock is Apple in the 2000s or Sea Containers in the 1970s, this trusty stock-market pattern has resulted in great rewards for investors over the decades.\n- An increase in earnings is the most important quality in a good stock\n- Innovative companies can make for a good return, but you need to know when to invest in them\n- Supply and demand is an important factor in stock picking\n- You should buy industry leaders\n- You should look for stocks with institutional sponsorship\n- You should keep a close eye on the general market direction\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3Y0-Keho9Y>\n\n- RULE OF 72\n- RULE OF 114\n- RULE OF 70\n- 10-5-3 RULE\n- 100 MINUS AGE RULE\n- 4% WITHDRAWAL RULE\n- 50-30-20 RATIO\n- 3X EMERGENCY FUND RULE\n- 1 WEEK SPENDING RULE\n- 40% EMI RULE\n- 20X LIFE COVER RULE\n\n## Personal Finance 4 pillars\n\n- **Protection**\n\nAdequate life insurance (To ensure your dependants don't struggle in your absence), Health & accident insurance (To ensure the expenses don't cause a financial strain & portfolio drawdown).

It encapsulates a wide variety of actions ranging from financial tracking to the formation of a continuity plan (To ensure your dependants can continue in the case of your demise). Central to these is ensuring that wills are made, the right nominations have been selected/updated, and the sharing of important documents.\n\n## How to Get Rich (Without Getting Lucky) by Naval Ravikant\n\n- Seek wealth, not money or status\n\n## Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep\n\n## Money is how we transfer time and wealth\n\n## Status is your place in the social hierarchy\n\n- Undestand **ethical wealth creation** is possible\n\nIf you secretly despise wealth, if will elude you\n\n- Ignore people playing **status games**\n\nThey gain status by attacking people playing **wealth creation games**\n\n- You're not going to get rich **renting** out your time\n\nYou must own **equity -** a piece of business - to gain your financial freedom\n\n- You will get rich by giving **society** what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale\n- Pick an industry where you can play long-term **games** with long-term **people**\n- The internet has massively broadned the possible **space of careers.** Most people haven't figured this out yet\n- Play **iterated games.** All the **returns** in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from **compound interest.**\n- Pick business partners with high intelligence, enery and above all integrity\n- Don't partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling\n- Learn to **sell.** Learn to **build.** If you can do both, you will be unstoppable\n- Arm yourself with **specific knowledge, accountability,** and **leverage**\n- Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be **trained for.** If society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you\n- Speific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now\n- Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others\n- When specific knowledge is **taught**, it's through apprenticeships, not schools\n- Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated\n- Embrace accountability and take business risks under your own name.

Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you\n- Code & media are **permissionless leverage.** They're the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software & media that works for you while you sleep\n- An **army of robots** is freely available - it's just packed in data centers for heat & space efficiency.

If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it\n- Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work\n- Become **the best** in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until that is true\n- There are no get rich quick schemes. That's just someone else getting rick off you\n- Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve\n- When you're finally wealthy, you'll realize that it **wasn't** what you were seeking in the first place.
