The process of converting a paper format share certificate into a digital format share certificate is called \"Dematerialization\" often abbreviated as DEMAT.\n\nAt present, there are only two depositaries offering you DEMAT account services. They are The National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) and Central Depository Services (India) Limited. There is virtually no difference between the two and both of them operate under strict SEBI regulations.\n\nJust like the way you cannot walk into National Stock Exchange's office to open a trading account, you cannot walk into a Depository to open a DEMAT account. To open a DEMAT account you need to liaison with a Depository Participant (DP). A DP helps you set up your DEMAT account with a Depository. A DP acts as an agent to the Depository. Needless to say, even the DP is governed by the regulations laid out by the SEBI.\n\n## NSCCL and ICCL\n\nNSCCL -- National Security Clearing Corporation Ltd and Indian Clearing Corporation are wholly owned subsidiaries of National Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange respectively.\n\nThe job of the clearing corporation is to ensure guaranteed settlement of your trades/transactions. For example, if you were to buy 1 share of Biocon at Rs.446 per share there must be someone who has sold that 1 share to you at Rs.446 . For this transaction, you will be debited Rs.446 from your trading account and someone must be credited that Rs.446 toward the sale of Biocon. In a typical transaction like this the clearing corporation's role is to ensure the following:\n\na) Identify the buyer and seller and match the debit and credit process\n\nb) Ensure no defaults -- The clearing corporation also ensures there are no defaults by either party. For instance the seller after selling the shares should not be in a position to back out thereby defaulting in his transaction.\n\n[**https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/the-ipo-markets-part-1/**](https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/the-ipo-markets-part-1/)\n\n1. Before understanding why companies go public, it is important to understand the origin of business\n\n2. The people who invest in your business in the pre-revenue stage are called Angel Investors\n\n3. Angel investors take the maximum risk. They take in as much risk as the promoter\n\n4. The money that angels give to start the business is called the seed fund\n\n5. Angel's invest relatively a small amount of capital\n\n6. Valuation of a company simply signifies how much the company is valued at. When one values the company they consider the company's assets and liabilities\n\n7. Face value is simply a denominator to indicate how much one share is originally worth\n\n8. Authorized shares of the company are the total number of shares that are available with the company\n\n9. The shares distributed from the authorized shares are called the issued shares. Issued shares are always a subset of authorized shares.\n\n10. The shareholding pattern of a company tells us who owns how much stake in the company\n\n11. Venture Capitalists invest at an early stage in business; they do not take as much risk as Angel investors. The quantum of investments by a VC is usually somewhere in between an angel and private equity investment\n\n12. The money the company spends on business expansion is called capital expenditure or CAPEX\n\n13. Series A, B, and C, etc are all funding that the company seeks as they start evolving. Usually higher the series, higher is the investment required.\n\n14. Beyond a certain size, VCs cannot invest, and hence the company seeking investments will have to approach Private Equity firms\n\n15. PE firms invest large sums of money and they usually invest at a slightly more mature stage of the business\n\n16. In terms of risk, PE's have a lower risk appetite as compared to VC or angels\n\n17. Typical PE investors would like to deploy their own people on the board of the investee company to ensure business moves in the right direction\n\n18. The valuation of the company increases as and when the business , revenues and profitability increases\n\n19. An IPO is a process by means of which a company can raise fund. The funds raised can be for any valid reason -- for CAPEX, restructuring debt, rewarding shareholders, etc\n\n<https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/the-ipo-markets-part-2>\n\n## IPO sequence of events\n\n- **Appoint a merchant banker -** In case of a large public issue, the company can appoint more than 1 merchant banker\n- **Apply to SEBI with a registration statement--** The registration statement contains details on what the company does, why the company plans to go public and the financial health of the company\n- **Getting a nod from SEBI**-- Once SEBI receives the registration statement, SEBI takes a call on whether to issue a go-ahead or a 'no go' to the IPO\n- **DRHP**-- If the company gets the initial SEBI nod, then the company needs to prepare the DRHP. A DRHP is a document that gets circulated to the public. Along with a lot of information, DRHP should contain the following details:\n\n  - The estimated size of the IPO\n\n  - The estimated number of shares being offered to the public\n\n  - Why the company wants to go public and how does the company plan to utilize the funds along with the timeline projection of fund utilization\n\n  - Business description including the revenue model, expenditure details\n\n  - Complete financial statements\n\n  - Management Discussion and Analysis -- how the company perceives future business operations to emerge\n\n  - Risks involved in the business\n\n  - Management details and their background\n- **Market the IPO**-- This would involve TV and print advertisements in order to build awareness about the company and its IPO offering. This process is also called the IPO roadshow\n- **Fix the price band**-- Decide the price band between which the company would like to go public. Of course, this can't be way off the general perception. If it is, then the public will not subscribe for the IPO\n- **Book Building**-- Once the roadshow is done and the price band fixed the company now has to officially open the window during which the public can subscribe for shares. For example, if the price band is between Rs.100 and Rs.120, then the public can actually choose a price they think is fair enough for the IPO issue. The process of collecting all these price points along with the respective quantities is called Book Building. Book building is perceived as an effective price discovery method\n- **Closure**-- After the book building window is closed (generally open for few days) then the price point at which the issue gets listed is decided. This price point is usually the price at which maximum bids have been received.\n- **Listing Day--** This is the day when the company actually gets listed on the stock exchange. The listing price is the price decided based on market demand and supply on that day and the stock is listed at a premium, par or discount of the cut-off price\n\n## What happens after the IPO?\n\nDuring the bidding process (also called the date of issue) investors can bid for shares at a particular price within the specified price band. This whole system around the date of the issue where one bids for shares, is referred to as thePrimary Market. The moment the stock gets listed and debuts on the stock exchange, the stock starts to trade publicly. This is called thesecondary market.\n\nOnce the stock transitions from primary markets to secondary markets, the stock gets traded daily on the stock exchange. People start buying and selling stocks regularly.\n\n## Few key IPO jargons\n\n## Under subscription -- Let's say the company wants to offer 100,000 shares to the public. During the book-building process, it is discovered that only 90,000 bids were received, then the issue is said to be under subscribed. This is not a great situation to be in as it indicates negative public sentiment\n\n## Oversubscription -- If there are 200,000 bids for 100,000 shares on offer then the issue is said to be oversubscribed 2 times (2x)\n\n## Green Shoe Option--Part of the underwriting agreement which allows the issuer to authorize additional shares (typically 15 percent) to be distributed in the event of oversubscription. This is also called the overallotment option\n\n## Fixed Price IPO-- Sometimes the companies fix the price of the IPO and do not opt for a price band. Such issues are called fixed price IPO\n\n## Price Band and Cut off price-- Price band is a price range between which the stock gets listed. For example, if the price band is between Rs.100 and Rs.130, then the issue can list within the range. Let's says it gets listed at 125, then 125 is called the cut off price\n\nOFS - Offer For Sale\n\nFPO - Follow-on Public Offer (Further Public Offer)\n\n<https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/supplementary-note-ipo-ofs-fpo>\n\n## Party Fund Stocks\n\nGet in and out quickly and use the money to party\n\nThe National Association of Software & Services company (NASSCOM)\n\n## Absolute Return -[Ending Period Value / Starting Period Value -- 1]*100\n\n## Trader\n\nA trader is a person who spots an opportunity and initiates the trade with an expectation of profitably exiting the trade at the earliest given opportunity. A trader usually has a short term view on markets. A trader is alert and on his toes during market hours constantly evaluating opportunities based on risk and reward. He is unbiased toward going long or going short. We will discuss what going long or short means at a later stage.\n\n## There are different types of traders\n\n- Day Trader-- A day trader initiates and closes the position during the day. He does not carry forward his positions. He is risk averse and does not like taking overnight risk. For example -- He would buy 100 shares of TCS at 2212 at 9:15AM and sell it at 2220 at 3:20 PM making a profit of Rs.800/- in this trade. A day trader usually trades 5 to 6 stocks per day.\n\n- Scalper-- A type of a day trader. He usually trades very large quantities of shares and holds the stock for very less time with an intention to make a small but quick profit. For example -- He would buy 10,000 shares of TCS as 2212 at 9:15 and sell it 2212.1 at 9.16. He ends up making 1000/- profit in this trade. In a typical day, he would have placed many such trades. As you may have noticed a scalp trader is highly risk averse.\n\n- Swing Trader-- A swing trader holds on to his trade for slightly longer time duration, the duration can run into anywhere between few days to weeks. He is typically more open to taking risks. For example -- He would buy 100 shares of TCS at 2212 on 12thJune 2014 and sell it 2214 on 19thJune 2014.\n\nSome of the really successful traders the world has seen are -- George Soros, Ed Seykota, Paul Tudor, Micheal Steinhardt, Van K Tharp, Stanley Druckenmiller etc\n\n## Scalper\n\n[Scalpers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/scalpers.asp) are a specific type of short-term trader that may dart in and out of a stock or other [asset class](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp) dozens, or in some cases even hundreds, of times a day.\n\n- Scalpers are often high-energy individuals who thrive during times of stress and have the means and temperament to handle the high trading volume.\n- Most often, because scalping requires considerable time, money, and skill, scalpers are professional traders.\n\n<https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/02/081902.asp>\n\n## Investor\n\nAn investor is a person who buys a stock expecting a significant appreciation in the stock. He is willing to wait for his investment to evolve. The typical holding period of investors usually runs into a few years. There are two popular types of investors..\n\n- Growth Investors-- The objective here is to identify companies which are expected to grow significantly because of emerging industry and macro trends. A classic example in the Indian context would be buying Hindustan Unilever, Infosys, Gillette India back in 1990s. These companies witnessed huge growth because of the change in the industry landscape thereby creating massive wealth for its shareholders.\n\n- Value Investors-- The objective here is to identify good companies irrespective of whether they are in growth phase or mature phase but beaten down significantly due to the short term market sentiment thereby making a great value buy. An example of this in recent times is L&T. Due to short term negative sentiment; L&T was beaten down significantly around August/September of 2013. The stock price collapsed to 690 all the way from 1200. At 690 (given its fundamentals around Aug 2013), a company like L&T is perceived as cheap, and therefore a great value pick. Eventually it did pay off, as the stock price scaled back to 1440 around May 2014.\n\n## 20 - Market Depth\n\n<https://zerodha.com/z-connect/featured/introducing-20-depth-or-level-3-data-beta-on-kite>\n\n<https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/supplementary-note-the-20-market-depth>\n\n## Bull Market (Bullish) -- If you believe that the stock prices are likely to go up then you are said to be bullish on the stock price. From a broader perspective, if the stock market index is going up during a particular time period, then it is referred to as the bull market\n\n## Bear Market (Bearish) -- If you believe that the stock prices are likely to go down then you are said to be bearish on the stock price. From a broader perspective, if the stock market index is going down during a particular time period, then it is referred to as the bear market\n\n## Trend -- The term 'trend' usually refers to the general market direction, and its associated strength. For example, if the market is declining fast, the trend is said to be bearish. If the market is trading flat with no movement then the trend is said to be sideways\n\n## Face value of a stock -- Face value (FV) or par value of a stock indicates the fixed denomination of a share. The face value is important with regard to a corporate action. Usually, when dividends and stock split are announced they are issued keeping the face value in perspective. For example, the FV of Infosys is 5, and if they announce an annual dividend of Rs.63/- then it means the dividend paid is 1260%s (63 divided by 5)\n\n## 52 week high/low -- 52 week high is the highest point at which a stock has traded during the last 52 weeks (which also marks a year) and likewise 52 week low marks the lowest point at which the stock has traded during the last 52 weeks. The 52 week high and low gives a sense of the range within which the stock has traded during the year. Many people believe that if a stock reaches 52 week high, then it indicates a bullish trend for the foreseeable future. Similarly, if a stock hits 52 week low, some traders believe that it indicates a bearish trend for a foreseeable future\n\n## All-time high/low -- This is similar to the 52 week high and low, with the only difference being the all-time high price is the highest price the stock has ever traded from the time it has been listed. Similarly, the all-time low price is the lowest price at which the stock has ever traded from the time it has been listed\n\n## Upper Circuit/Lower Circuit -- The exchange sets up a price band at which the stock can be traded in the market on a given trading day. The highest price the stock can reach on the day is the upper circuit limit and the lowest price is the lower circuit limit. The limit for a stock is set to 2%, 5%, 10% or 20% based on the exchange's selection criteria. The exchange places these restrictions to control excessive volatility when a stock reacts to certain news related to the company\n\n## Long Position -- Long position or going long is simply a reference to the direction of your trade. For example, if you have bought or intend to buy Biocon shares then you are said to be long on Biocon or planning to go long on Biocon respectively. If you have bought the Nifty Index with an expectation that the index will trade higher then essentially you have a long position on Nifty. If you are long on a stock or an index, you are said to be bullish\n\n## Short Position -- Going short or simply 'shorting' is a term used to describe a transaction carried out in a particular order. This is a slightly tricky concept\n\nThe concept of shorting is very counter-intuitive simply because we are not used to 'shorting' in our day to day activity unless you have a trader mentality 🙂\n\nGoing back to stock markets, think about this very simple transaction -- on day 1 you buy shares of Wipro at Rs.405, two days later (day 3) the stock moves and you sell your shares at Rs.425. You made a profit of Rs.20/- on this transaction.\n\nIn this transaction, your first leg of the trade was to buy Wipro at Rs.405, and the second leg was to sell Wipro at Rs.425, and you were bullish on the stock.\n\nGoing forward, on day 4, the stock is still trading at Rs.425, and you are now bearish on the stock. You are convinced that the stock will trade lower at Rs.405 in a few days' time. Now, is there a way you can profit out of your bearish expectation? Well, you could, and it can be done so by shorting the stock.\n\nYou sell the stock at Rs.425, and 2 days later assuming the stock trades at Rs.405, you buy it back.\n\nIf you realize the first leg of the trade was to sell at Rs.425, and the second leg was to buy the stock at Rs.405. This is always the case with shorting -- you first sell at a price you perceive as high with the intention of buying it back at a lower price at a later point in time.\n\nYou have actually executed the same trade as buying at Rs.405 and selling at Rs.425 but in reverse order.\n\nAn obvious question you may have -- How can one sell Wipro shares without owning it. Well, you can do so, just like the way I sold a phone that I did not own.\n\nWhen you first sell, you are essentially borrowing it from someone else in the market, and when you buy it back, you actually return the shares back. All this happens in the backend, and the stock exchange facilitates the process of borrowing and returning it back.\n\nIn fact, when you short a stock, it works so seamlessly that you will not even realize that you are borrowing it from someone else. From your perspective, all you need to know is that when you are bearish on the stock, you can short the stock, and the exchange takes care of borrowing the stock on your behalf. When you buy the stocks back, the exchange will ensure the stocks are returned back.\n\nWhen you short, you have a bearish view on the stock. You profit if the stock price goes down. After you short, if the stock price goes up, you will end up making a loss\n\nWhen you short you essentially borrow from another market participant, and you will have to deliver these shares back. You need not worry about the mechanics of this. The system will ensure all this happens in the background\n\nShorting a stock is easy -- either you call your broker and ask him to short the stock or you do it yourself by selecting the stock you wish to short, and click on sell\n\nFor all practical purposes, if you want to short a stock, and hold the position for few days, it is best done on the derivatives markets\n\nWhen you are short, you make money when the stock price goes down. You will make a loss if the stock price goes up after you have shorted the stock.\n\nTo summarize long and short positions...\n\nPosition1st Leg2nd LegExpectationMake money whenYou will lose money if\n\nLongBuySellBullishStock goes upStock price drops\n\nShortSellBuyBearishStock goes downStock price goes up\n\n## Square off ­-- Square off is a term used to indicate that you intend to close an existing position. If you are long on a stock squaring off the position means to sell the stock. Please remember, when you are selling the stock to close an existing long position you are not shorting the stock\n\nWhen you are short on the stock, squaring off a position means to buy the stock back. Remember when you buy it back, you are just closing an existing position and you are not going long!\n\nWhen you areSquare off position is\n\nLongSell the stock\n\nShortBuy the stock\n\nIntraday position -- This is a trading position you initiate with an expectation to square off the position within the same day.\n\n## Short Covering\n\nShort covering refers to buying back borrowed securities in order to close out an open short position at a profit or loss. It requires purchasing the same security that was initially [sold short](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortselling.asp), and handing back the shares initially borrowed for the short sale. This type of transaction is referred to as [buy to cover](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buytocover.asp).\n\n- Short covering can result in either a profit (if the asset is repurchased lower than where it was sold) or for a loss (if it is higher).\n- Short covering may be forced if there is a short squeeze and sellers become subject to margin calls. Measures of short interest can help predict the chances of a squeeze.\n\n<https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortcovering.asp>\n\n## Short Squeeze\n\nA short squeeze is an unusual condition that triggers rapidly rising prices in a stock or other tradable security. For a short squeeze to occur, the [security](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp) must have an unusual degree of short sellers holding positions in it. The short squeeze begins when the price jumps higher unexpectedly. The condition plays out as a significant measure of the short sellers coincidentally decide to cut losses and exit their positions.\n\n- A short squeeze accelerates a stock's price rise as short sellers bail out to cut their losses.\n- Contrarian investors try to anticipate a short squeeze and buy stocks that demonstrate a strong short interest.\n- Both short sellers and contrarians make risky moves. A wise investor has additional reasons for shorting or buying that stock.\n\n<https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsqueeze.asp>\n\n<https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/050715/what-difference-between-short-squeeze-and-short-covering.asp>\n\n\"Short covering\" and \"short squeeze\" are different terms to describe a situation involving short positions. A short squeeze is a situation in which a security's price increases significantly, causing short sellers to close their short positions. Conversely, short covering involves buying back a security to close out an open short position.\n\n## Volume -- Volumes and its impact on the stock prices is an important concept that we will explore in greater detail in the technical analysis module. Volumes represent the total transactions (both buy and sell put together) for a particular stock on a particular day. For example, on 17th June 2014, the volume on ACC was 5, 33,819 shares\n\n## Market Segment -- A market segment is a division within which a certain type of financial instrument is traded. Each financial instrument is characterized by its risk and reward parameters. The exchange operates in three main segments\n\n1. **Capital Market --** Capital market segments offer a wide range of tradable securities such as equity, preference shares, warrants, and exchange-traded funds. Capital Market segment has sub-segments under which instruments are further classified. For example, common shares of companies are traded under the equity segment abbreviated as EQ. So if you were to buy or sell shares of a company you are essentially operating in the capital market segment\n\n2. **Futures and Options (F&O) --** Futures and Option, generally referred to as the equity derivative segment is where one would trade leveraged products. We will explore the derivative markets in greater depth in the derivatives module\n\n3. **Wholesale Debt Market --** The wholesale debt market deals with fixed income securities. Debt instruments include government securities, treasury bills, bonds issued by a public sector undertaking, corporate bonds, corporate debentures, etc.\n\n<https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/commonly-used-jargons>\n\n- MIS - Margin Intraday Settlement\n- CNC - Cash and Carry\n\nSelect CNC for delivery trades. Meaning if your intention is to buy and hold the shares for multiple days/months/years then you need to ensure the shares reside in your Demat account. Selecting CNC is your way of communicating this to your broker.\n\nSelect NRML or MIS if you want to trade intraday. MIS is a margin product;\n\nBuy Today, Sell Tomorrow\" (BTST) or \"Acquire Today, Sell Tomorrow\" (ATST)\n\n## Complexity\n\nSimple Order\n\nAMO - After Market Orders (after 3:30)\n\n## CO - Cover Order\n\nStop loss is must (good for intraday traders, long term investors not so much)\n\nOCO - One Cancels Other (Bracket Order)\n\nBoth target price and stop loss price\n\n## Order Type\n\n## Market Order - No bargain, buy at market face value\n\nwhen you intend to buy at market available prices instead of a very specific price that you have in mind\n\n## Limit - Add your bid for the stock\n\nwhen you are very particular about the price you want to pay for a stock.\n\n## SL Limit\n\nstop loss order\n\n## SL Market\n\n## Position\n\n## Intraday - Don't send to demat account\n\n## Delivery - Send to demat account\n\n## TIF (Time in Force)\n\n## Day - Till the end of day if Limit get's triggered\n\n## IOC - Now or never at Limit order\n\n## OHLC - Open (O), high (H), low (L), and close (C)\n\nOHLC stands for open, high, low and close. We will understand more about this in the technical analysis module. For now, open is the price at which the stock opens for the day, high is the highest price at which the stock trade during the day, low is the lowest price at which the stock trades during the day and the close is the closing price of the stock. For example, the OHLC of ACC on 17th June 2014 was 1486, 1511, 1467 and 1499.\n\nThe **Last tradedprice(LTP)** usually differs from the**closing price** of the day. This because theclosing priceof the day on NSE is the weighted averagepriceof the last 30 mins of trading. Last tradedpriceof the day is the actual last tradedprice.\n\n## Gap up opening\n\n## Gap down opening\n\n## EPS (TTM) - Earnings per Share (Trailing Twelve Months)\n\nTrailing 12 months (TTM) is a term used to describe the past 12 consecutive months of a company's performance data, that's used for reporting financial figures.\n\n## Book value reflects the total value of a company's assets that shareholders of that company would receive if the company were to be liquidated\n\nThe [book value](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookvalue.asp) literally means the value of a business according to its books (accounts) that is reflected through its [financial statements](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp). Theoretically, book value represents the total amount a company is worth if all its assets are sold and all the liabilities are paid back. This is the amount that the company's creditors and investors can expect to receive if the company is liquidated.\n\n## GDR\n\nAglobal depository receipt(GDRand sometimes spelleddepositary) is a general name for a [depositary receipt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depositary_receipt) where a certificate issued by a [depository bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depository_bank), which purchases [shares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_(finance)) of foreign companies, creates a [security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)) on a local [exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange) backed by those shares. They are the global equivalent of the original [American depositary receipts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_depositary_receipt)(ADR) on which they are based. GDRs represent ownership of an underlying number of [shares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shares) of a foreign company and are commonly used to invest in companies from developing or [emerging markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_markets) by investors in developed markets.\n\nPrices of global depositary receipt are based on the values of related shares, but they are traded and settled independently of the underlying share. Typically, 1 GDR is equal to 10 underlying shares, but any ratio can be used. It is a [negotiable instrument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negotiable_instrument) which is denominated in some freely convertible currency.GDRs enable a company, the issuer, to access investors in [capital markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_market) outside of its home country.\n\nSeveral international banks issue GDRs, such as [JPMorgan Chase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase), [Citigroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup), [Deutsche Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank), [The Bank of New York Mellon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bank_of_New_York_Mellon). GDRs are often listed in the [Frankfurt Stock Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_Stock_Exchange), [Luxembourg Stock Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg_Stock_Exchange), and the [London Stock Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stock_Exchange), where they are traded on the International Order Book (IOB).\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_depository_receipt>\n\n## Orders\n\n- **Product types**\n  - CNC (Cash n Carry)\n  - MIS (Margin Intraday Squareoff)\n  - NRML (Normal F&O trades)\n- **Order types**\n  - Limit (LMT) order\n  - Market (MKT) order\n  - Stoploss or trigger orders (SL and SL-M)\n  - Good till triggered (GTT)\n    - Single trigger\n    - OCO (One Cancels the Other) trigger\n  - Basket orders\n- **Advanced order types**\n  - Regular orders with time validity\n  - Cover orders\n  - Cover order with limit entry\n  - AMO (After market orders)\n\n<https://kite.trade/docs/kite/orders>\n\n## LTCG\n\nTo prevent gains from building up, experts suggest harvesting. This means booking a portion of your profits and reinvesting the proceeds. So you sell a part of your equity holdings to book long term capital gains, and then buy back the same shares or mutual fund units.\n\nHarvest losses too when you still can\n\nThis exercise can be replicated even when you are investing via SIPs in mutual funds. If you started the SIP about a year ago, start redeeming units after they complete a year and reinvest the proceeds in the same or different fund. This will reset the buying price and ensure your capital gains do not overshoot the Rs 1 lakh tax free threshold.\n\nif you are not able to set off your entire capital loss in the same year, you can carry forward these losses for up to 8 assessment years.\n\n<https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/tax/heres-a-trick-to-lower-your-tax-on-capital-gains-from-equity/articleshow/73095582.cms>\n\n## Demat Account\n\nDemat means dematerializing shares into digital format rather than on physical paper.\n\nThe demat account is used as a bank where shares bought are deposited in, and where shares sold are taken from.\n\n## Trading Account\n\nA trading account is used to place buy or sell orders in the stock market.\n\n## Benchmark Exchange Traded Schemes (BeEs)\n\n[Nippon India ETF Nifty BeES vs UTI Nifty Index Fund: Which is better?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HGazJ61Qu8)\n\n## Exchange-traded fund (Index ETF)\n\nAn exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a collection of securities - such as stocks - that tracks an underlying [index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketindex.asp).\n\nAn ETF is called an exchange-traded fund since it's traded on an exchange just like stocks. The price of an ETF's shares will change throughout the trading day as the shares are bought and sold on the market. This is [unlike mutual funds](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/mutual-fund-etf.asp), which are not traded on an exchange, and trade only once per day after the markets close.\n\n## CFD (Contract for Difference)\n\nThe [contract for difference (CFD)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contractfordifferences.asp) offers European traders andinvestors an opportunity to profitfrom price movement without owning the underlying asset. It's a relatively simple securitycalculatedby the asset's movementbetween trade entry and exit, computing only the price changewithoutconsideration of the asset's underlying value.1﻿ This is accomplished through a contract between client and broker, and does not utilize any stock, forex, commodityor futures exchange.Trading CFDsofferseveral major advantagesthat haveincreased the instruments' enormous popularityin the past decade.\n\n## Binary Option\n\nA binary option is a financial product where the buyer receives a payout or loses their investment, based on if the option expires [in the money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inthemoney.asp). Binary options depend on the outcome of a \"yes or no\" proposition, hence the name \"binary.\" Binary options have an expiry date and/or time. At the time of expiry, the price of the [underlying asset](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying-asset.asp) must be on the correct side of the [strike price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp)(based on the trade taken) for the trader to make a profit.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col style=\"width: 17%\" />\n<col style=\"width: 82%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th><strong>capital gains tax</strong></th>\n<th>a tax on a positive return on an investment resulting from the sale price of a security being higher than the purchase price</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>capital loss</strong></td>\n<td>a negative return on an investment resulting from the sale price of a security being lower than the purchase price</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)</strong></td>\n<td>a type of stock plan that allows employees to purchase shares of company stock via accumulated payroll deductions, sometimes at a discount</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>holding period</strong></td>\n<td>this refers to the amount of time that stocks or options must be held before they can be sold or exercised; the holding period requirements are described in the plan documents</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>in the money</strong></td>\n<td>a stock option is \"in the money\" when the current market price of your company stock is above the grant price</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>out of the money</strong></td>\n<td>a stock option is \"out of the money\" or \"under water\" when its grant price is above the current market price</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>positions</strong></td>\n<td>refers to the stock you hold in your account for a particular company; for example, if you hold stock in 2 different companies within your account, you have \"2 positions\"</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>restricted stock award (RSA)</strong></td>\n<td>a grant of company stock in which your rights to the stocks are restricted until the award vests, also known as a lapse in restrictions; once the shares vest, they are deposited into your Fidelity Account®and are yours to hold, sell, or transfer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>restricted stock unit (RSU)</strong></td>\n<td><p>a grant valued in terms of company stock that is restricted until the award vests; after the vesting requirement is satisfied, your company distributes shares or the cash equivalent</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restricted-stock-unit.asp\">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restricted-stock-unit.asp</a></p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>stock appreciation right (SAR)</strong></td>\n<td>an award that provides the holder with the ability to profit from the appreciation in value of a set number of shares of company stock over a set period of time</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>stock swap</strong></td>\n<td>a form of stock option exercise in which you exercise your option to acquire shares of your company stock by exchanging shares of a stock you currently own instead of cash to pay the exercise cost</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>stop order</strong></td>\n<td>stop orders are generally used to protect a profit or to prevent further loss if the price of a security moves against you; they can also be used to establish a position in a security if it reaches a certain price threshold or to close a short position; not all securities or trading sessions (pre- and post-market) are eligible for stop orders</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>vesting</strong></td>\n<td>this refers to when the participant has earned the right of ownership and the options or restricted stock becomes available to sell; vesting occurs after your company-designated time frame is met (also known as a vesting schedule)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>vesting schedule</strong></td>\n<td>the schedule of when, and to what extent, awards become available based on periods of time (options and restricted stock)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<https://www.fidelity.com/glossary/stock-plan-services-glossary>\n\n- Last traded price (LTP)\n- Pre opening market session: 9 to 9:15\n- 9 to 9:07am placing orders\n- 9:07am to 9:11am matching\n- 9:11am to 9:15am stabilization\n- 4:00pm to 9:15am After market order (AMO approved next 9:15am)\n\n- Green up triangle is Gap up Opening I.e opening higher than previous price. Red down triangle is Gap down opening. Opening lower than previous price.\n- Unch= unchanged I.e. Opening same as previous price.\n- Bid price= buy price eg.

Numerous of people wanting to sell the share at this price.\n- Bonus: eg 1:2 I.e one share bonus for each 2 share held.\n- We must buy 1 day before the ex bonus date to be entitled of bonus.\n- Announcement date; bonus declared date.\n- Record date: date on which shared should be on your demat account.\n- Ex bonus date: date on which share start trading on the revised price.\n\n## Types of investor\n\n- RII: Retail individuals investor. Eg who invest in IPO for below Rs 2 lacs\n- HNI: high net worth individuals. Eg. Above 2 lacs\n\n[HNI CATEGORY IN IPO | HOW IS GREY MARKET PREMIUM CALCULATED IN IPO? | LIVE EXAMPLE |](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJc9Jujzmj0)\n\n- DII: domestic institutional investor. Eg. Bank, lic. Mutual funds etc\n- FII/FPI: Foreign institutional investors/ foreign portfolio investors. Eg. Foreign investment\n- T+2 day: trade date + two days. After to says money in account or share in account\n\n## Clearing house\n\n- NSCCL : National Security clearing corporation ltd. For NSE\n- ICCL: Indian clearing corporation limited. For BSE\n- XMSEI: Metropolitan Clear.\n\n## Depositories and DPs\n\n- Depositories: they convert the physical share to dematerialize share. Eg NSDL and CDSL\n- DP: depository participants: they are the broker.\n- Flow: my account link to broker account link to depository.\n\n## Stock Market Crash\n\nHow should an investor deal with the possibility of a stock market crash?\" - Three available options for a portfolio of high-quality companies\n\n1. **Preemptive timing:** Sit on cash in anticipation of a stock market crash, and deploy the cash at the bottom of the stock market crash.\n\n2. **Ride the tide:** Stay fully invested at all times since we can't time the markets, and do nothing during the stock market crash.\n\n3. **Post-facto rebalancing:** Stay fully invested at all times, and rebalance the portfolio for position sizing dislocations caused by the differential in drawdowns across our portfolio constituents during the stock market crash.\n\n## Stocks\n\n- **EQ:** It stands for Equity. In this series [intraday trading](https://tradesmartonline.in/blog/what-is-intraday-trading-basics-for-beginners-in-stock-market/) is possible in addition to delivery.\n- **BE:** It stands for Book Entry. Shares falling in the Trade-to-Trade or T-segment are traded in this series and no intraday is allowed. This means trades can only be settled by accepting or giving the delivery of shares.\n- **BL:**This series is for facilitating block deals.Block deal is a trade, with a minimum quantity of 5 lakh shares or minimum value of Rs. 5 crore, executed through a single transaction, on the special \"Block Deal window\". The window is opened for only 35 minutes in the morning from 9:15 to 9:50AM.\n- **BT:**This series provides an exit route to small investors having shares in the physical form with a cap of maximum 500 shares.\n- **BZ:** Stocks that are blacklisted for violation of exchange rules. This series stocks falls under Trade-to-Trade category and hence BTST (Buy Today Sell Tomorrow) and intraday is not allowed in such stocks.\n- **GC:** This series allows Government Securities and Treasury Bills to be traded under this category.\n- **IL:** This series allows only FIIs to trade among themselves. Permissible only in those securities where maximum permissible limit for FIIs is not breached.\n\n## New Fund Offer (NFO)\n\nA New Fund Offer (NFO) refers to the introductory offer of a scheme by an [asset management company](https://www.paisabazaar.com/mutual-funds/asset-management-company/). A New fund offer is raised when a fund is launched, which helps the firm raise capital for purchasing securities. An investor can subscribe to an NFO only within a limited time period; hence, NFOs are functional on first-come-first serve basis.\n\n## Types of NFO\n\n- [Open-ended funds](https://www.paisabazaar.com/mutual-funds/open-ended-funds/): This fund is officially launched after the NFO ends. Investors can enter and exit the fund at any time after the launch.\n- Close-ended funds: A [close-ended fund](https://www.paisabazaar.com/mutual-funds/closed-end-funds/) does not allow the entry and/or exit of investors after the NFO period, until its maturity. This time period is typically 3-4 years from the launch date. However, the investors may buy and sell the units of such a fund on the stock market in theory, but the liquidity of such funds on the market tends to be low.\n\n<https://www.paisabazaar.com/mutual-funds/all-about-nfo>\n\n## SAFE Note - Simple Aggrement for Future Equity\n\nSAFE (simple agreement for future equity) notes are a simpler alternative to [convertible notes](https://www.upcounsel.com/convertible-notes). They were created in 2013 by Y Combinator, a Silicon Valley accelerator, and allow startups to structure seed investments without interest rates or maturity dates. SAFEs are short five-page documents. The valuation caps are the only negotiable detail.\n\nA SAFE note is a convertible security that, like an option or warrant, allows the investor to buy shares in a future priced round. It addresses many of the drawbacks and challenges posed by convertible notes and can be an equitable option for investors and [founders](https://www.upcounsel.com/blog/the-one-thing-that-every-new-entrepreneur-should-know). Startups may prefer SAFE notes because, unlike convertible notes, they are not debt and therefore do not accrue interest.\n\n<https://www.upcounsel.com/safe-notes>\n\n## Term sheet\n\n- A term sheet is a nonbinding agreement outlining the basic terms and conditions under which an investment will be made.\n- Term sheets are most often associated with startups. Entrepreneurs find that this document is crucial to attracting investors, such as venture capitalists (VC) with capital to fund enterprises.\n- The company valuation, investment amount, percentage stake, voting rights, liquidation preference, anti-dilutive provisions, and investor commitment are some items that should be spelled out in the term sheet.\n\n<https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termsheet.asp>\n","excerpt":"Market Terms Created: 2020-04-21 02:05:56 +0500 Modified: 2022-03-03 23:58:02 +0500 Market timings Equity 9 am to 9.15 am
