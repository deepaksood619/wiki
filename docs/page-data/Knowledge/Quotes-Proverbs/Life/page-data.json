But you'll definitely be unhappy in the one you have if you spend all day thinking about what else is out there.\n\nThe surefire way to end up worse off is to agonize over unchosen options and fail to make the most of the one you selected. Every minute spent yearning for your unlived lives is a moment you can't invest in the one you actually have.\n\nChoices matter, but so does your level of commitment.\n\nI strongly believe that the only way to encourage innovation is to give it to the young. The young have a great advantage in that they are ignorant. Because I think ignorance in science is very important. If you're like me and you know too much you can't try new things. I always work in fields of which I'm totally ignorant.\n\nDon't react to toxic people. Not giving them a reaction when they desperately seek it, is far more powerful\n\nQuality of life is having the freedom to make choices that are not fear based. Whether it's the ability to choose the kinds of projects I want to take on and can learn from, or the ability to take a month off to travel. Freedom to choose is the ultimate luxury.\n\nWhat's in a name?
