Your ability and willingness to do the difficult thing makes life easier.\n\n## Deliberate Practice\n\n## Grit is passion and perseverance for long term goals\n\n## Do things, learn from them, repeat\n\n## Invest in Yourself\n\n## No self doubt (be bold)\n\nDuty is joy\n\n## DREAM BIG\n\n## All things start small\n\n## Little Big Things\n\n## Getting Started\n\n## Hope is a waking dream - Nelson Mandela\n\n## Does this activity fill me with energy or drain me of energy?\n\n## What are you working on when time fades away?\n\nYou have to dream before your dreams can come true -- Maulana Kalam Azad\n\nThe antidote to a bad day is a good workout.\n\nThe more you move, the easier it is to keep moving. Maintain the momentum.\n\nMany people wish they started sooner. Almost nobody wishes they started later.\n\nIf you work, inspiration will come.\n\nIf you wait, inspiration will too.\n\nEntrepreneur's mind.\n\nAthlete's body.\n\nArtist's soul.\n\nIt always seems impossible until it's done -- Nelson Mandela\n\n## If not now, when, if not me then who\n\nIf I think I have won, the game is over for me!\n\n\"Just have one good day. Then repeat.\"\n\nWhether it is easy or hard, never lose your focus as to where you want to go. -- Sadhguru\n\nHappiness starts with you -- not with your relationships, job, or money.\n\nThe more disciplined your environment is, the less disciplined you need to be. Don't swim upstream.\n\nLaziness is nothing more than the habit of resting before you get tired -- Jules Renard\n\nMotivation comes and goes. If you want to do something consistently, then don't pick a level of difficulty that requires great motivation.\n\nMake it easy enough and simple enough that you'll do it even when you don't feel very motivated.\n\nTo reduce stress, start sooner. To be happy, learn to finish what you started.\n\nThe hardest thing to do is leaving your comfort zone. But you have to let go of the life you're familiar with and take the risk to live the life you dream about\n\nAntifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder by Nassim Nicholas Taleb\n\n## Antifragile\n\n- Bones\n- Immune System\n- Children\n\n[Jonathan Haidt: The Three Terrible Ideas Weakening Gen Z and Damaging Universities and Democracies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5IGyHNvr7E)\n\n\"Raise your ambitions. Lower your expectations.\n\nThe higher your ambitions, the bolder your actions.\n\nThe lower your expectations, the greater your satisfaction.\n\nAchieve more and be happy along the way.\"\n\nMy success mantra is really straightforward -- set 10X goals, work 10X as hard, provide 10X the value to clients, and make the lives everyone involved better. I think one should keep improving every month since you lose when you stop.\n\nCrying is all right in its way while it lasts. But you have to stop sooner or later, and then you still have to decide what to do -- C.S. Lewis\n\n\"Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it.\"\n\n## Genius - to have a disinterested obsession with something that matters\n\n<http://paulgraham.com/genius.html>\n\nWhen making plans, think big, When making progress, think small.\n\nKnowledge and Action\n\nwhat you learn is RIGHT and the actions you take is CORRECT\n\nThe foundation of all achievement is action\n\nMost big, deeply satisfying accomplishments in life take at least five years to achieve. This can include building a business, cultivating a loving relationship, writing a book, getting in the best shape of your life, raising a family, and more.\n\nFive years is a long time. It is much slower than most of us would like. If you accept the reality of slow progress, you have every reason to take action today. If you resist the reality of slow progress, five years from now you'll simply be five years older and still looking for a shortcut.\n\nOptimism isn't a belief that everything will go well all the time. It's a belief that despite the inevitable challenges, we will make progress. We need more of it.\n\n## How you are motivated\n\n1. You are motivated by others success use that to drive yourself\n\n2. Iiitd delhi 1.5 crore package\n\n## State of Flow - 4 conditions\n\n1. Focus - When your life is on the line, it's easy to focus, belive that what you need to do is very important (when people say that your goal must be bigger than yourself)\n\n2. Challenge skill balance - Challenge must be slightly harder than your skillset, you cannot overwhelm yourself, or too low. Flow exists between 45 degree angle between anxiety and boredom. The only easy day was yesterday. It should be slightly harder from the last time everyday.\n\n3. Clear goals (specific with immediate feedback)\n\n4. Flow is 4 state\n\n   - priming/overwhelm don't attach to frustration\n\n   - release (sex/walk/drive)\n\n   - Learning and memory consolidation state\n\n   - Struggle\n\n## Blogs\n\n<https://theascent.pub/how-to-be-so-disciplined-itll-look-like-you-have-superpowers-e35d695f49d5>\n\n## Motivation\n\n- Peace of Mind\n- I have the power to do and to be whatever i wish to do and be.\n- No negative thoughts\n- No one can limit us but ourselves\n- I have courage because I desire it; because I need it; because I use it and because I refuse to become such a weakling as cowardice produces.\n- Love what you do and put a smile on your face while doing it\n- Find play in everything you doi\n\n## Story\n\n\"Todd, what do you think about writing only when you feel motivated? I feel like I always do my best work when I get a spark of creativity or inspiration, but that only happens every now and then. I'm pretty much only writing when I feel like it, which means I'm inconsistent. But if I write all the time, then I'm not creating my best work.\"\n\n\"That's cool,\" Todd replied. \"I only write when I'm motivated too. I just happened to be motivated every day at 8am.\"\n\n## Psychology of self-motivation\n\n1. Empowerment\n\n   - Can you do it? (self-efficacy)\n\n   - Will it work?

C - word\n\n   - Competance\n\n   - Consequences drive us\n\n   - Choice (success seeker)\n\n   - Community (relatedness)\n\n[The psychology of self-motivation | Scott Geller | TEDxVirginiaTech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sxpKhIbr0E)\n\n## Teddy/Theodore Roosevelt's famous speech titled \"The Man in the Arena\"\n\n\"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.\"\n\n## Relentless by Tim Grover\n\nTim Groverwas the athletic trainer used by Michael Jordan (and many elite NBA players). Here he is describing the three things he asks of every player:\n\n\"I don't care how much you can lift, how fast you can run, how many pull-ups you can do, or whether you can hit a three while blindfolded. There are only three things I ask of every client... Show up, work hard, and listen. That's it. It requires no talent, no special genetics, or any skill whatsoever to show up, work hard, and listen.\"\n\nHe adds:\n\n\"When I train my athletes, it's a dictatorship withthree rules: show up, work hard, and listen. If you can do those three things, I can help you. If you can't we have no use for each other. I will bust my ass for you every way possible, but I expect you to do the same for yourself. I'm not going to work harder than you do for your benefit. Show me you want it, and I'll give it to you.\"\n\n## Qualities that lead to increasing intelligence\n\n1. The curiosity to experiment and explore.\n\n2. The honesty to observe the world as it is, not as you wish it to be.\n\n3. The humility to kill your favorite ideas when you learn something new.\n\n4. The consistency to repeat this cycle for life.\n\nThree common patterns to the problem of motivation:\n\n1. **DRIVE:** You don't have a strong enough drive to learn.\n\n2. **ANXIETY:** You have too strong an aversion to learning.\n\n3. **DISTRACTION:** You have something else that motivates you more.\n\nThe fact that you go to the gym even though you don't \"need\" to... is why you don't need to.\n\nThe fact that you save when you could spend... is why you have money to spend.\n\nYour habits create your strength.\n\nWhen you build a habit, you don't have to spend mental energy deciding what to do -- The Heart to State by David Kadavy\n\nIt'sneveras bad as you think it is at the time, and there is always a silver lining -- The Golden rule of career catastrophes\n\nYou can make any job a work of art if you put the right energy into it.\n\nLive as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever. -- Gandhi\n\nGod, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, The courage to change the things I can, And the wisdom to know the difference. -- Reinhold Niebuhr\n\nDiscomfort causes Growth (Growth rings)\n\nEvery action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. Start small: a habit must be established before it can be improved. Never miss twice. --Atomic Habits\n\nCourage is not the absence of fear, but the ability to act despite it. -- Archbishop Desmond Tutu\n\nMost people overestimate what they can do in a day, but underestimate what they can do in a year.\n\nPeople tend to overestimate what can be done in one year and to underestimate what can be done in five or ten years. -- JCR Licklider, co-creator of the internet\n\n## Law of serendipity - Lady luck favours the one who tries\n\n<https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/annus-mirabilis>\n\nLuck favors the prepared Mind -- Pasteur\n\nWe cannot control our luck - good or bad - but we can control our effort and preparation.\n\nLuck smiles on us all from time to time. And when it does, the way to honor your good luck is to work hard and make the most of it.\n\nBeing pleasant and having a good attitude is a simple way to become luckier.\n\nOpportunities come through people, and people are more likely to bring opportunities to people they like.\n\nIt's hard to win if your attitude adds friction to every interpersonal experience.\n\nIf others would think as hard as I did, then they would get similar results -- Newton\n\nThe more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity\n\nHealth is not just being disease-free. Health is when every cell in your body is bouncing with life. -- Sadhguru\n\nKeep your eye on the price\n\nDo everything like it is the last thing you do. There is nothing to hold back, nothing to save for later. -- Sadhguru\n\nSuccess is a few simple disciplines, practiced every day; while failure is simply a few errors in judgment, repeated every day. -Jim Rohn\n\nIt's more important to start, than to succeed\n\nOptimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence -- Helen Keller\n\nJust because you can't do everything you want to do, doesn't mean you should give up and do nothing -- Jerry Bostick\n\nFall down seven times, stand up eight\n\nSport suspends Reality for you, allowing you a breath of fresh air from the rigors of the mundane. -- Sadhguru\n\nDevotion is the highest form of intelligence. When you overflow with sweetness of Devotion, then you function at your Best -- Sadhguru\n\nEveryone has dreams, but how many are willing to stake their life to fulfill that dream? -- Sadhguru\n\nExcellence is not about being better than someone else. Excellence means to function with utmost ease and at your best. -- Sadhguru\n\nTo iterate is human, to recurse divine -- L. Peter Deutsch\n\nPerhaps \"great', is just \"good\", but repeatable.\n\nIf you cannot do great things, do small things a great number of times\".\n\nIf you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way -- Napolean Hill\n\n\"The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.\" - Atomic Habits, James Clear\n\n\"You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading ittoday.\" -- Abraham Lincoln\n\nIt doesn't take any great intellect or qualifications to create something wonderful, just absolute devotion towards what you wish to do. -- Sadhguru\n\nRemember don't HOPE for a fantastic week, hope is not a strategy! Let's make it so! :) --Jim Kwik\n\nMaking progress in your health, your work, and your life isn't about learning how to focus and concentrate better, it's about learning how to choose and commit to a specific task. -- James Clear\n\nDon't just sit there, do something. Without action, there is no outcome.\n\nIn the long-run (and often in the short-run), your willpower will never beat your environment.\n\nPractice is the price you pay today to be better tomorrow.\n\nThe essence of Inner Engineering is to engineer yourself in such a way that every moment of your life is a new possibility. -- Sadhguru\n\nIf there is total clarity, there is no need for courage, because clarity will carry you across. -- Sadhguru\n\nAn intention will not make things happen. It will only set the direction. You still have to make the journey. -- Sadhguru\n\nThere is really no limit as to what one can do. Because capabilities can be constantly enhanced. -- Sadhguru\n\nIn a complex world, constant experiments and relentless incremental progress win the day. -- Sadhguru\n\nAll that moves will exhaust itself. Only that which is still, is for always. Meditation is essentially to move towards that stillness, to become like the core of existence. -- Sadhguru\n\nNothing wonderful is ever going to happen unless we actively make it happen. -- Sadhguru\n\nThere are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it.-- Edith Wharton\n\nIt's remarkable what you can build if you just don't stop.\n\nIt's remarkable the business you can build if you don't stop working.\n\nIt's remarkable the body you can build if you don't stop training.\n\nIt's remarkable the knowledge you can build if you don't stop learning.\n\n10 Lessons for a Good Life\n\n1. Focus on what you want (not on what you don't want)\n\n2. Do it\n\n3. Show initiative\n\n4. Be contrarian\n\n5. Show up\n\n6. Quit things that don't work (but don't give up)\n\n7. Stay in shape\n\n8. Rest often\n\n9. Ignore pessimists\n\n10. Remind yourself what you want\n\n\"If you want to increase your success rate, double your failure rate.\" - Thomas Watson\n\nCourageous people do idiotic things. Fearful people do little. Fearless people see life as it is and do what is needed. -- Sadhguru\n\nAn ant on the move does more than a dozing ox. -- Lao Tzu\n\nSomeone says something nasty to you because something nasty is happening within them. They need your love, compassion, or distance. Do not let the spiral of nastiness suck you in. -- Sadhguru\n\nNew, challenging situations are possibilities, not problems. A problem would be if nothing new happens to you. -- Sadhguru\n\nWhether you can perform like someone else or not is not the point. The question is, are you exploring the full depth of your potential. -- Sadhguru\n\nFocus is the art of knowing what to ignore.\n\nThree types of Energy\n\n- Mental energy (Meditation)\n\nYour ability to concentrate, focus, work, pay attention, listen,\n\n- Physical energy (Exercise)\n\nYour ability to perform physical tasks.\n\n- Emotional energy (Human interaction)\n\nYour ability to show compassion to yourself and to others.\n\n<https://dariusforoux.com/manage-personal-energy>\n\nSuccess will come easy once you function at your full potential. -- Sadhguru\n\nWhen life doesn't challenge you, challenge yourself.\n\nThose who know how to learn... know enough. - - Henry Adams\n\nDo not think about enlightenment -- look at your limitations and how to go beyond them. That's the way to progress. -- Sadhguru\n\nEvery action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.\n\nJohn Gardner, a politician and a recipient of the 1964 Presidential Medal of Freedom, on how to live a meaningful life:\n\n\"There's a myth that learning is for young people. But as the proverb says, 'It's what you learn after you know it all that counts.' The middle years are great, great learning years. Even the years past the middle years. I took on a new job after my 77th birthday -- and I'm still learning. Learn all your life. Learn from your failures. Learn from your successes, When you hit a spell of trouble, ask 'What is it trying to teach me?' The lessons aren't always happy ones, but they keep coming\n\nIf every moment of your life, no matter what the nature of your work or your life situations, you can remain playful and exuberant, that means you are liberated. -- Sadhguru\n\nThe one who follows the crowds will usually get no further than the crowd. The one who walks alone, is likely to find himself in places no one has ever been.\n\nIf you are content with who you are right now, you are not aware who you could be if you are willing to strive. -- Sadhguru\n\nTough times never last, but tough people do.\n\nAlways seeking the unknown and believes the impossible is just lack of trying\n\n\"Without hard work, a great strategy remains a dream.\n\nWithout a great strategy, hard work becomes a nightmare.\"\n\n![image](media/Motivation-image1.jpg)\n\nTo achieve great things, two things are needed: a plan, and not quite enough time. -- Leonard Bernstein\n\nPatience and perseverance, if we have them, overcome mountains of difficulties -- Mahatma Gandhi\n\n\"Someday\" is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you.\"-Tim Ferriss\n\n\"If the only reason you're not pursuing a dream is because of the length of time it will take to achieve it, you should start right now.

By developing four key skills --⁠ motivation, learning, creativity, and flow --⁠ you'll gain the power to smash whatever goals you set. With enough time, you may even achieve the impossible.\n\n## What's in it for me? Reach your maximum potential and achieve the impossible\n\nThere are two kinds of impossible. One is **Impossible**, with a capitalI. These \"Impossible\" feats break paradigms and shatter expectations --⁠ think landing on the moon or running a four-minute mile.\n\nThen, there's **impossible** with a lowercasei. This sort of impossible still lies beyond your wildest dreams --⁠ but on a personal scale. It's the stuff you think is impossiblefor you. It could be becoming an entrepreneur, building a musical career, or simply doing what you love for a living.\n\n## Intrinsic motivators drive us toward the impossible\n\nThere are no two ways about it: your journey to impossible is going to be long and arduous. As with any long journey, you'll need fuel to keep you going. That includes food and sleep, but you also need psychological fuel --⁠ in other words, drive.\n\nDrive, or motivation, nudges us toward action. But what creates drive in the first place? From an evolutionary perspective, it's all about surviving in a world where resources are scarce. Drive is evolution's way of getting us to either fight each other to obtain the resources we need or to use creativity to makemoreresources.\n\nBut drive doesn't consist of just one thing. There are various drivers, like fear, curiosity, and passion. All of these provide psychological fuel --⁠ and you can harness them to achieve the impossible.\n\nAll psychological drivers are divided into one of two categories:**extrinsicorintrinsic**. Extrinsic drivers are things like **money, fame, food, and sex.** They're external to ourselves, and we chase them to win the evolutionary survival game. Intrinsic drivers, on the other hand, are within us. They're psychological and emotional concepts like curiosity, passion, meaning, and purpose.\n\nPsychological research tells us that extrinsic drivers only motivate us to a certain extent. They get weaker once we have enough money to pay for food, clothing, and shelter. After we've met these basic needs, it's the intrinsic motivators that take over. It's those intrinsic drivers we'll be focusing on in these blinks.\n\nThe five most powerful intrinsic motivators are **curiosity, passion, purpose, autonomy, and mastery.** You can stack them together so they feed off one another --⁠ and so you can achieve the impossible.\n\n- Write down --⁠ by hand --⁠ 25 things you're curious about\n\nWhen you explore your curiosities, your brain rewards you with small amounts of a feel-good chemical known as **dopamine**.\n\n- What you need is passion, which provides a much greater dopamine boost. Often, you can find your passions by looking for intersections among your curiosities.\n- Autonomy simply means the freedom to pursue your purpose. To cultivate it, try carving out at least 15 percent of the day just for yourself. This will help increase your motivation.\n- mastery --⁠ the desire to get better at the things you do. For this motivator, you need to get into a special state of mind psychologists call **flow**.\n\n## Break up the impossible into large and small goals\n\nAccording to Latham, big goals lead to the largest increases in motivation and productivity. These are called**high, hard goals, or HHGs** for short. They're the major steps on your way to achieving your purpose. Your HHG might be, for instance, getting a degree in nutrition or starting a company.\n\nHHGs can take years to achieve. So you'll need smaller daily targets along the way. Let's call these**clear goals**; theytake you closer to your HHGs. Say you're a writer, and your HHG is to pen a novel. One of your clear goals might be to write 500 words every day between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m.\n\nCompleting your clear goals will reward you with dopamine. Even so, endless persistence can be tough. That's where **grit** comes in --⁠ the energy it takes to push through years of hard work. Some people are more naturally gritty than others. But don't worry if that's not you. It's a skill you can improve.\n\nOne way to cultivate grit is to work around your natural energy levels. Willpower is a major aspect of grit, and it deteriorates throughout the day. So schedule your most difficult daily task for the morning, when your energy is at its peak. Then, continue your tasks in order of descending importance.\n\nAs you complete goals, your brain rewards your persistence with dopamine. Grit will become easier --⁠ and the impossible will become more realistic.\n\n## Growth mindset\n\n## Use the five-step process to learn almost anything\n\n- Reading\n- Notes\n- Questions\n- Deep dive\n\n## Creativity requires activating three different networks in the brain\n\nNow, neuroscientists know a little bit more about what creativity is neurologically. It involves two different networks in the brain working in tandem: **attention** and **imagination**.\n\nAttention allows us to concentrate and make choices. Imagination takes care of what happens when our minds wander --⁠ whether it's daydreaming, making plans, or imagining future scenarios.\n\nWhen we're thinking creatively, these two systems are working in tandem --⁠ something they don't normally do. Creative people can keep both systems active at once, seamlessly switching from attention to imagination and back. That's exactly what you'll need to learn to do if you want to cultivate creativity.\n\n## Salience network\n\nThe job of this network is to let you know that an idea you've just had is worth your attention. It also controls your ability to shift between your attention and imagination faculties. And, importantly, it also conducts **repetition suppression**. That means it suppresses familiar stimuli so that you experience them as normal rather than new and exciting. But in creatives, the salience network **doesn't** engage in repetition suppression in the same way. That means they tend to notice beauty and novelty where others may not.\n\n## A positive mood boosts your creativity\n\nInsight, it turns out, is core to creativity. And you don't just have to wait for it to suddenly appear. Instead, you can cultivate it. How? By strengthening a particular part of the brain called the anterior cingulate cortex, or ACC, which is part of the salience network.\n\nBrain-imaging studies have shown that the ACC lights up right before we solve a problem using \"aha\" insight. So what can make the ACC more active? The answer is simpler than you might think. Put simply --⁠ a good mood.\n\nBad moods lead to analytical thought. That makes sense because when you feel threatened or scared, your brain wants to search for what's familiar. It makes a beeline for the path of action it knows will work.\n\nBut when you're in a good mood, the opposite is true. You don't feel threatened, and your mind is free to wander. It can switch between the attention and imagination networks. This allows you to pay attention to new, different, maybe slightly weird possibilities --⁠ and then act on them.\n\nSo how do you cultivate a good mood? There are many ways, including a daily gratitude practice, meditation, exercise, and good-quality sleep.\n\nTake gratitude. Our brains are overwhelmingly focused on the negative since we're trained to always look out for danger. The downside is that negativity leads to high stress levels. A daily practice of gratitude --⁠ just writing down ten things you're grateful for each day --⁠ trains your brain to pay more attention to the positive instead.\n\n## Flow is the ultimate condition for achieving the impossible\n\n## Flow - The state is characterized by complete focus on the present moment. Mood-boosting chemicals flood our brains, while stress hormones are flushed away. Productivity is amplified by up to 500 percent. Learning rates soar 230 percent\n\nIt's no wonder that flow makes us feel like we can achieve the impossible. So how do you get some flow for yourself? The process consists of four stages.\n\n1. **Struggle -** Here, you're learning, taking in loads of new information, and feeling frustrated as a result.\n\n2. **Release -** it's time to give your brain time to relax and let go by doing things like exercising, going for a walk, or engaging in a light hobby. During this time, your brain will be busy passing what you've learned into your long-term memory.\n\n3. **Reward -** To get into flow, give yourself a large chunk of time with no external distractions to work on your project.\n\n4. **Recovery -** Flow costs a lot of energy, and you've got to replenish it somehow. So have a healthy meal, get some good sleep, or take a long bath.\n\n## Final summary\n\n## Follow the 80/20 rule\n\nWhen you're trying to master a skill, try the 80/20 approach popularized by the author and investor Tim Ferriss. The idea is that 80 percent of your results stem from 20 percent of your actions. Say you want to learn to play a new musical instrument. Most pop songs consist of just four or five chords, so mastering those chords alone can take you a long way. When you're trying to master a skill, be sure to focus on the 20 percent that really matters.\n\nIf I keep doing what I am about to do today for the next five years, will I end up with more of what I want or less of what I want?\n\n\"Too often, we fall into an all-or-nothing cycle with our habits.\n\nThe problem is not slipping up; the problem is thinking that if you can't do something perfectly, then you shouldn't do it at all.\"\n\nInstead of feeling that you've blown the day and thinking, \"I'll get back on track tomorrow,\" try thinking of each day as a set of four quarters: morning, midday, afternoon, evening. If you blow one quarter, you get back on track for the next quarter.\n\nFail small, not big.\n\n\"The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change:\n\nWhat gets rewarded, gets repeated. What gets punished, gets avoided.\n\nDon't reward behavior you don't want to see repeated.\"\n\n\"The bad days are more important than the good days.\n\nIf you write or exercise or meditate or cook when you don't feel like it, then you maintain the habit.\n\nAnd if you maintain the habit, then all you need is time.\"\n\n\"You can usually accomplish more by giving something your full effort for a few years rather than giving it a lukewarm effort for fifty years.\n\nPick a priority for this season of your life and do it to the best of your ability.\"\n\n\"If you want a significant change in your results, then you probably need a significant change to your strategy. Working harder on your current strategy is unlikely to move the needle.\n\nBefore you work harder, work on the right thing.\n\nPlay better games. Win better prizes.\"\n\n\"Know what you want.\n\nFollow a trajectory where what you want is a possible outcome.\n\nBuild a system to incrementally improve your ability to follow that trajectory.\n\nTrust yourself.\n\nEnjoy the outcomes.\n\nRepeat.\"\n\nThere are hundreds of paths up the mountain, all leading in the same direction, so it doesn't matter which path you take. The only one wasting time is the one who runs around and around the mountain, telling everyone that his or her path is wrong.\n\n\"A brief guide to compounding:\n\nIf you don't enjoy something, you won't stick with it.\n\nIf you don't stick with it, it won't compound.\n\nBeing interested precedes the results.\n\n## Blinkist - Chasing Excellence by Ben Bergero\n\nStory about building the fittest athelete\n\nAthletic excellence isn't an elusive condition that only exists in people with the right DNA or natural talent. Anyone can achieve this excellence, as long as they have the passion, commitment and willingness to grow in more than just physical strength. If you want to master a discipline, you must develop your mental fortitude and be willing to push yourself far beyond normal limits. Without this, you'll never reach the highest peaks.\n\nActionable advice:\n\nTry to think of improvement as getting better by 1 percent every day.\n\nThis kind of incremental improvement is called \"aggregation of marginal gains\" -- because small but meaningful buildup is a powerful tool. By the end of the year, you can make 100 percent improvements!\n\n- If it doesn't kill you, it makes you stronger.\n- Passion\n- Deliberate practice\n- Excellence requires a balance between strict control and knowing what you can't control\n- Double loop learning (considering internal + external factors)\n- Being humble\n- Feeling positive creates positive results\n- Your thoughts become your words, your words become your actions, and your actions dictate your destiny.\n- Intense training and training for worst situations\n- Having **grit** allows to push through limitations and achieve competitive excellence\n\n<https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/08/10/excellence>\n\n## Blinkist - Can't hurt me by David Goggins\n\n- When you're thinking of quitting: accept the pain and refuse to quit as a possibility\n- Push yourself daily to do what you don't want to do\n- Week after week expand the limits of your comfort zone little by little\n- Use enemies and hardships as fuel for your motivation\n- Build your cookie jar of accomplishments and use that for motivation\n- The best way to overcome anything in life is to become a master of what you're afraid of. Become a master of your insecurities.\n- It's easy to stand out among people and be a big fish in small pond. It's much more difficult when you're a wolf, surrounded by wolves.\n- Torch the complacency you feel gathering around you, continue to put obstacles in front of yourself because that's where you will find the friction that will help you grow even stronger.\n\n## Blinkist - The Dip by Seth Godin (19 Mar 2019)\n\nA little book that teaches you when to quit (and when to stick)\n\n- To be a superstar, you must do something exceptional. Not just survive the Dip, but use the Dip as an opportunity to create something so extraordinary that people can't help but talk about it, recommend it, and, yes, choose it.\n- The next time you catch yourself being average when you feel like quitting, realize that you have only two good choices: Quit or be exceptional. Average is for losers.\n- Winners understand that taking that pain now prevents a lot more pain later. Winners quit all the time. They just quit the right stuff at the right time.\n- The decision to quit or not is a simple evaluation: Is the pain of the Dip worth the benefit of the light at the end of the tunnel?\n- Quitting as a short-term strategy is a bad idea. Quitting for the long term is an excellent idea because it frees you up to excel at something else.\n- Quit the wrong stuff. Stick with the right stuff. Have the guts to do one or the other.\n- At the beginning, when you first start something, it's fun.Over the next few days and weeks, the rapid learning you experience keeps you going. Whatever your new thing is, it's easy to stay engaged in it. And then the Dip happens. The Dip is the long slog between starting and mastery. A long slog that's actually a shortcut, because it gets you where you want to go faster than any other path.\n- Knowing that you're facing a Dip is the first step in getting through it.\n- Quitting when you hit the Dip is a bad idea. If the journey you started was worth doing, then quitting when you hit the Dip just wastes the time you've already invested. Quit in the Dip often enough and you'll find yourself becoming a serial quitter, starting many things but accomplishing little\n- If you can't make it through the Dip, don't start.\n- If you're not able to get through the Dip in an exceptional way, you must quit. And quit right now\n\n## Blinkist - Design Your Future by Dominick Quartuccio (8 May 2019)\n\nThree simple steps to stop drifting and start living\n\n- Overcoming limiting ideas can help you avoid the trap of predictability\n  - Trapped is what you feel when you are living into a future of more of the same\n- Fear keeps people stuck in the status quo, but you can move forward by taking three simple steps\n  - Awakening (mindfulness)\n    - Observe yourself and your behavior\n  - Disrupting\n    - Breaking out of negative cycles\n  - Designing\n    - Creating a new, positive routine\n- Challenging habits and being picky about your social circle can help positively disrupt your life\n- Focusing on one goal at a time makes it much more likely that you'll fulfill your ambitions\n- Scorecards and daily rituals are great tools to help you design your future\n- Achieving success is all about keeping your eyes on the prize and taking things one step at a time\n- Reconnect to the old enthusiasm when you started the project, when the project gets difficult.

positive outlook and to find heroes to worship\n- For success, it is important to have a growth mind-set, especially when dealing with failures\n- To avoid procrastination, take things one step at a time and set yourself smart deadlines\n  - Prevent needless procrastination by avoiding dates that spill over into the following year, month or even week\n- To achieve your goals, you have to make tough decisions, so you should learn to embrace your fears\n- Being well-prepared for major events is crucial, and identifying potential probelems in advance helps\n- Being adaptable is important for achieving goals, and it also promotes happiness\n- **Actionable advice - Create your own competition to boost motivation**\n\n## The power of one more by Ed Mylett\n\n- Divide your days into 3 parts
