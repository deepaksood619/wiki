There is usually a path to get there in a few years instead of a few decades.\n\nIf the plan doesn't work, change the plan, but never the goal.\n\n![image](media/Business-Management-image1.png)\n\nSmarter people take more risks\n\nImagination is more important than Knowledge -- Albert Einstein\n\nWhatever problem you're struggling with is probably addressed in some book somewhere written by someone a lot smarter than you. -- Ryan Holiday\n\n\"The sooner you make a choice, the sooner you can make an adjustment.\"\n\n\"There are three types of people in the world: Those who are immovable, people who don't get it, or don't want to do anything about it; there are people who are movable, people who see the need for change and are prepared to listen to it; and there are people who move, people who make things happen.\" --- Benjamin Franklin\n\nIf I had asked the public what they wanted, they would have said a faster horse. -- Henry Ford\n\nPredictability is so unpredictable that you cannot even predict why it is unpredictable -- someone predictably unpredictable\n\nThe best properties are rarely for sale.\n\nThe best employees are rarely job hunting.\n\nThe best clients are rarely shopping.\n\nThe best option is usually off the market. Most people think this means you can't have it. What it really means is you have to go find it and sell yourself\n\nMore effort is wasted doing things that don't matter than is wasted doing things inefficiently.\n\nElimination is the highest form of optimization.\n\nA recipe for getting more out of what you read:\n\nStart more books. Quit most of them. Read the great ones twice.\n\nSaying no saves you time in the future. Saying yes costs you time in the future.\n\nNo is like a time credit. You can spend that block of time in the future.\n\nYes is like a time debt. You have to repay that commitment at some point.\n\nNo is a decision. Yes is a responsibility.\n\nStuck between a rock and a hard place. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.\n\nA Leader is one who knows the way, goes the way and shows the way\n\nPeople don't leave job, People leave managers.\n\nEvery minute spent in planning, saves ten minutes in execution\n\n\"The things you take pride in are the same things you are likely to be biased about.\n\nHow might the things you take pride in be misleading you?\n\nThe tighter you cling to your current identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it.\"\n\nI'm not interested in whether the glass is half empty or half full. I'm interested in figuring out how to fill the glass.\n\nIn many cases, improvement is not about doing more things right, but about doing less things wrong.\n\nDon't look for things to add. Look for things to eliminate.\n\nFrom good to great\n\nJames Collins, the best-selling author, and business guru makes a telling remark in the opening paragraph of his book 'Good to great' --- \"Good is the enemy of great. We don't have great schools, principally because we have good schools. We don't have great governments, principally because we have good governments. Few people attain great lives, in large part because it is just so easy to settle for a good life. The vast majority of companies never become great, precisely because the vast majority become quite good --- and that is their main problem.\"\n\nProfit is not an event. Profit is a habit. - Mike Michalowicz\n\nI need no help with increasing my talent pipeline -- said no recruiter ever\n\nIt was like riding a tiger, not knowing how to get off without being eaten -- Byrraju Ramalinga Raju\n\nThere is a difference between moving fast and rushing.\n\nYou can move fast and be thoughtful. When you rush, you sacrifice thoughtfulness.\n\nConversely, when you are thoughtful but not moving fast, you are overthinking it. Procrastination in disguise.\n\nDon't rush, but don't wait.\n\n\"Following through is related to focus, self-discipline, action, and persistence, but it is not synonymous to any of them. Rather, it is a composite of all of them.\" - Peter Hollins\n\nInvestor Dean Williams once said, \"Expertise is great, but it has a bad side effect. It tends to create an inability to accept new ideas.\"\n\nNever attempt to win by force, what can be won by deception\n\nFinancial projection appears to be a science that makes astrology look respectable -- Burton Malkiel\n\nBeing right is the enemy of staying right because it leads you to forget the way the world works. -- Jason Zweig\n\nSimple is nearly always better. But if it's going to be complicated, then make sure the problem is worth the complexity. A great deal of time is wasted creating complex solutions to relatively unimportant problems.\n\nServer the best, or you are just like the rest\n\nmy capex is your barrier to entry\n\nRemember: customers rarely care about how novel your technology is, only what problems it solves for them. Never lose sight of that as a startup.\n\nPessimists sound smart. Optimists make money\n\n\"Remove the branches of a thorn bush today and you'll avoid a scrape this year. But next year, you'll face the same problem again.\n\nRemove the root of the bush today, and the entire plant will die.\n\nAre you solving problems at the branch level or the root level?\"\n\nThere's many a slip between the cup and the lip\n\nThere's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip\n\nSuccess breeds complacency, complacency breeds failure. Only the paranoid survive -- Intel's ex-CEO, Andrew Grove\n\nWonderful businesses come with a curse of three. These are: surplus cash, surplus time, surplus confidence.\n","excerpt":"Business / Management Created: 2018-01-25 14:40:40 +0500 Modified: 2022-11-29 16:22:31 +0500 97.42% is a fictional number that
