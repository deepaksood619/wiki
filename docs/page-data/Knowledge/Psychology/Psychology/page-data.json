NLP's creators claim there is a connection between neurological processes (neuro-), language (linguistic) and behavioral patterns learned through experience (programming), and that these can be changed to achieve specific goals in life. Bandler and Grinder also claim that NLP methodology can \"model\" the skills of exceptional people, allowing anyone to acquire those skills.They claim as well that, often in a single session, NLP can treat problems such as phobias, depression, tic disorders, [psychosomatic illnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosomatic_illness), near-sightedness, allergy, common cold, and learning disorders\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming>\n\n## Full spectrum mapping for taking big decisions\n\n## RID\n\n- Reflect\n\nDeclutter your mind by creating a mental inventory.

Nevertheless, the notion that birth-order significantly influences personality continues to have a strong presence in [pop psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_psychology) and popular culture\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_order>\n\n## Types of behavior\n\n1. **Passive:** Indirect, dishonest, does not take control, is nice at all cost, focuses on others.\n\n2. **Assertive:** Direct, honest, self-worth, to the point, focuses on the self, respects others.\n\nBehavior which enables a person to act in his own best interests, to stand up for himself without undue anxiety, to express his honest feeling comfortably, or to exercise his own rights without denying the rights of others.\n\n3. **Aggressive:** Harmful, egocentric, will to win at any cost, justifies the means, wants to control others.\n\n## Rorschach Test\n\nTheRorschach testis a [psychological test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_test) in which subjects' perceptions of [inkblots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ink) are recorded and then analyzed using [psychological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology) interpretation, complex [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm), or both. Some psychologists use this test to examine a person's personality characteristics and emotional functioning. It has been employed to detect underlying [thought disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_disorder), especially in cases where patients are reluctant to describe their thinking processes openly.The test is named after its creator, Swiss psychologist [Hermann Rorschach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Rorschach). The Rorschach can be thought of as a psychometric examination of [pareidolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia), active distorted perception of visual stimuli.[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)]In the 1960s, the Rorschach was the most widely used [projective test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_test).\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_test>\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYi19-Vx6go>\n\n## Barnum Effect / Statement\n\nBarnum Effect, also called ForerEffect, in psychology, the phenomenon that occurs when individuals believe that personality descriptions apply specifically to them (more so than to other people), despite the fact that the description is actually filled with information that applies to everyone.\n\n## 4 stages of personal development\n\n1. Discovery\n\n2. Consumption\n\n3. Application\n\n4. Teaching\n\n## Defensive failure\n\nIt's what occurs when we want to achieve something and we think about it constantly but we don't do it.\n\nThis happens because of a few mental blocks that are keeping us locked in this cycle.\n\n- I just don't think I can do this\n- People like me aren't good at this\n- I have to do this, but I don't really want to\n\n## Seven Ways to Feel More in Control of Your Life\n\n## Control Stimuli\n\nActing independently begins with what you let into your mind - meaning what comes in from your environment. If you are lacking agency, it's likely your attention is being hijacked and you need to figure out how to restore it.\n\nTo help you increase your control, practice going to quiet and screen-free spaces to escape overstimulation.\n\n1. [**Associate selectively**](https://deepstash.com/idea/13067/associate-selectively)\n\nIt's impossible not to be affected by those around us - it's easy to \"catch\" their emotions and our brains tend to synch up when we associate with other people.\n\nWe should set boundaries with difficult people, disentangle yourself from negative online interactions, and be more conscious of how you might be vulnerable to \"groupthink\"-pressures to behave or think in ways that are contrary to your values.\n\n2. [**Move**](https://deepstash.com/idea/13068/move)\n\nPhysical movement can lead to greater self-control - the ability to defer gratification.\n\nIf you're in deep at work, set a timer to go off every hour and remind yourself to take a moment to assess your mood. If you're feeling stuck or overwhelmed, get up and move. And, if you're having any issues at work, discussing them in a walking meeting (instead of a sitting meeting) may help mitigate conflicts.\n\n3. [**Position yourself as a learner**](https://deepstash.com/idea/13069/position-yourself-as-a-learner)\n\nThis requires nurturing your curiosity and allowing yourself to explore new ideas, skills, and people.\n\nThis isn't always easy. Practicing a growth mindset - where you recognize that you are a work in progress, capable of learning and changing - can help combat the fear of failure or judgment that often come with learning new things\n\n4. [**Manage your emotions and beliefs**](https://deepstash.com/idea/13070/manage-your-emotions-and-beliefs)\n\nIncreasing your awareness of how your emotions and beliefs drive your thinking, influence your behavior, and affect your judgment will help you navigate life with greater confidence.\n\nWhile uncovering these inner thoughts and emotions may take effort, being more self-reflective helps you keep yourself grounded by slowing down your thinking process.\n\n5. [**Check your intuition**](https://deepstash.com/idea/13071/check-your-intuition)\n\nThink of intuition as deep inner knowledge that is comprised of millions of data points that our brains have observed over the course of our lives.\n\nWhen used wisely, it can be a tremendous boost to our creativity and help us make important decisions.\n\n6. [**Deliberate, then act**](https://deepstash.com/idea/13072/deliberate-then-act)\n\nWhen making an important decision, it's helpful to stop and deliberate first:\n\n- Focus on the issue at hand enough to clarify your primary objective and what is at stake.\n- Generate lots of options at first, making sure that any strong emotions or biases aren't driving your thoughts.\n- Draft a plan for yourself based on those options, putting your thoughts and decisions into writing.\n- Set your plan aside and come back a while later to reassess it, making changes as necessary.\n\n<https://deepstash.com/article/2260/seven-ways-to-feel-more-in-control-of-your-life>\n\nWhy are we yelling\n\n1. 5:1 disagreements\n\n2. Productive arguments\n\n3. Backfire effect\n\n4. Arguments never ends\n\n5. Head True, heart meaningful, hand useful\n\n6. Project our own fears\n\n7. Anxiety\n\n8. Cognitive dissonance\n\nSpending money not equal to happiness\n\nDon't seek external validation for happiness\n\nSigmund Freud - Psychoanalysis\n\n- Mass consumer persuasion\n- Product placement in movies\n- Moved humans from needs (things you need) to desire (you want it, doesn't matter if you need it or not)\n- Dress has become an expression\n- Consumptionism\n- Consumerism\n\n## Priming Effect\n\nThe priming effect occurs when an individual's exposure to a certain stimulus subconsciously influences his or her response to a subsequent stimulus. These stimuli are often related to words or images that people see during their day-to-day lives.\n\n## Types\n\n- [1.1 Positive and negative

Regret\n\n[THE POWER OF REGRET by Daniel Pink | Core Message](https://youtu.be/CPsxbUod2UU)\n\n## Anticipate future regret\n\n## Foundation regrets: If only I'd done the work\n\nFor example: \"If only I'd drank less and maintained a disciplined diet, I wouldn't have so many health problems today.\" Or \"If only I'd worked hard in my twenties, I wouldn't be in this dead‐end job today.\"\n\n## Boldness regrets: If only I'd taken that risk\n\nFor example: \"If only I'd asked that girl out.\" Or \"If only I'd started that business.\"\n\n\"If foundation regrets arise from the failure to plan ahead, work hard, follow through, and build a stable platform for life, boldness regrets...arise from the failure to take full advantage of that platform - to use it as a springboard into a richer life.\" ‐ Daniel Pink\n\n## Moral regrets: If only I'd done the right thing\n\nFor example: \"I wish I hadn't bullied that kid in school.\" Or \"I wish I'd been faithful to my wife.\"\n\n## Connection regrets: If only I'd reached out\n\n\"If only I'd reached out to my friend before she died of cancer.\" Or \"If only I'd apologized to my son and mended our relationship sooner.\"\n\n## The weekly regret template\n\nNow that you know the four universal regrets, try to anticipate how your future‐self (living seven days in the future) might complete the following sentences:\n\nFoundation Regrets (neglecting your health, professional growth, or finances):\n\n- I wish I'd taken care of my health this week by...\n- I wish I'd advanced my career this week by...\n- I wish I'd increased my savings this week by...\n\nBoldness Regrets (too afraid to take emotional and social risks):\n\n- I wish I'd tried...\n- I wish I'd started...\n- I wish I'd asked...\n\nMoral Regrets (not doing the right thing in difficult situations):\n\n- I wish I'd remained loyal to...\n- I wish I'd been kinder to...\n- I wish I'd stood up for...\n\nConnection Regrets (letting key relationships drift):\n\n- I wish I'd reached out to...\n- I wish I'd forgiven...\n\n## Resources\n\n[Self Help Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGwmAEmjn4fnPC_VpwRiD60w6axy1Txbd) - Think School\n\n[Dr. Gabor Maté on The
