For example, suppose membership in a group is one of the qualitative variables relevant to a regression. If group membership is arbitrarily assigned the value of 1, then all others would get the value 0. Then the intercept would be the constant term for non-members but would be the constant term plus the coefficient of the membership dummy in the case of group members.\n\nDummy variables are used frequently in [time series analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series_analysis) with regime switching, seasonal analysis and qualitative data applications.\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_variable_(statistics)>\n\nWe need only k-1 dummy variables to represent the information about k categories.\n\n## Weight of Evidence\n\nTo what extent an independent variable would predict a dependent variable\n\n<https://www.listendata.com/2015/03/weight-of-evidence-woe-and-information.html>\n\n## Fine classing\n\n![image](media/Course-Credit-Risk-Modeling_Intro-image2.png)\n\n## Coarse classing\n\nThe process of constructing new categories based on the initial ones\n\n## Information value\n\nHow much information the original independent variable brings with respect to explaining the dependent variable\n\n- Widely used in credit risk modeling\n\n![image](media/Course-Credit-Risk-Modeling_Intro-image3.png)\n\n![image](media/Course-Credit-Risk-Modeling_Intro-image4.png)\n\n## Overfitting\n\nOur statistical power has focused on a particular dataset so much that it has missed the point\n\n## Underfitting\n\nWhen the model fails to capture the underlying logic of the data\n\n## Logistic Regression\n\n- The logistic regression module of scikit learn does not have a built-in way to calculate p-values\n- One of the cleanest ways is to alter .fit() from the LogisticRegression class\n- Each original independent variable is represented by several dummy variables\n- If the coefficients for all of these dummy variables are statistically significant, we should retain all of them, and if the coefficients for none of the dummy variables are statistically significant, we should remove all of them\n- If one or few dummy variables representing one original independent variable are statistically significant, it would be best to retain all dummy variables that represent that original independent variable.\n- Conventionally, if a p-value is lower than 0.05, we conclude that the coefficient of a variable is statistically significant\n\nlogistic_regression_model.predit\n\nlogistic_regression_model.predit_proba\n\nAUC curve , RoC curve\n\n![image](media/Course-Credit-Risk-Modeling_Intro-image5.png)\n\n## Gini - Measure of the inequality between rich and poor individuals in an economy\n\n- Measure inequality between good (non-defaulted) and bad (defaulted) borrowers\n- the cumulative proportion of defaulted borrowers as a function of the cumulative proportion of all borrowers.\n- AUROC = (Gini -- 1) / 2.\n\n![image](media/Course-Credit-Risk-Modeling_Intro-image6.png)\n\n## Kolmogorov-Smirnov\n\nShows to what extent the model seperate the actual good borrowers from the actual bad borrowers\n\n![image](media/Course-Credit-Risk-Modeling_Intro-image7.png)\n\n## K-S coefficient\n\n- The maximum difference between the cumulative distribution functions of good and bad borrowers\n- The greater the difference the better the model (the further apart they are better the results, since model is able to clearly tell the difference between good and bad borrowers)\n- Perfect model -> Maximum distance -> K-S = 1\n- Predicting by chance -> Almost no distance -> K-S = 0\n\n- ScoreCard\n\nThe scores in the scorecard we created are: transformations of the regression coefficients of the PD model.\n\nIf we want to calculate the credit score of an applicant, it is enough to: sum the scores of each variable's categories from the scorecard where the applicant belongs.\n\nThe way we created our scorecard, to obtain an estimate for the PD of an applicant, using score, we have to: raise an exponent to the power of total score and divide that by the same thing plus one.\n\n- Cut off rate\n\n    1. Predetermines the total number of borrowers that will be approved and rejected\n\n    2. Impacts the quality of loans\n\nSetting a higher cut-off score for approval of credit applications will result in:\n\n- Questions\n\n    1. In the lecture we saw the approval and rejection rate if we set the cut-off at no less than 95% probability of being 'good'? What would be the closest equivalent cut-off in terms of credit score?\n\n    2. What would be the approval and rejection rate if we set the cut-off at no less than 94% probability of being 'good'? What would be the closest equivalent cut-off in terms of credit score?\n\n    3. What would be the approval and rejection rate if we set the cut-off at credit score 670 points? What is the corresponding probability of being 'good'?\n\n    4. Where should we set the cut-off if we want our approval rate to be just below 14%? What credit score and what probability of being 'good'?\n\n- Model maintenance\n  - 6 months/1 year\n  - Number of applicants as a benchmark\n  - Example - Redevelop our model after 50,000/100,000 new data points\n\n- **PSI (Population Stability Index) /CSI (Characteristics Stability Index)**\n\nPSI and CSI, both of these metrics focus on the shift in thePOPULATION DISTRIBUTION.\n\nThese two monitoring metrics are based on the premise that a predictive model works best when the development and the validation/OOT (out of time) samples are not significantly different in terms of economic conditions, underlying assumptions, the campaign-style, and focus, etc.\n\nFor example: if we built a predictive model to predict attrition rate for credit card customers in normal economic circumstances and then if we proceed onto testing it against a sample from recession-hit times, the model might not be able to predict accurately as the population distribution in different income segments might have changed significantly which might drive the actual attrition rate really high but the model might not be able to capture it, thus, predicting erroneous results. But, as we understand this now and if we proceed onto checking the population distribution shifts between the DEV time and the current time, we can get a fair idea if the model results are reliable or not. And this is accomplished by PSI and CSI as important monitoring metrics.\n\n## PSI tends to overall population shift whereas CSI tends to focus on the individual model variables used\n\nPSI can help us determine the overall population distribution comparison with the DEV sample and if it shows a significant shift then CSI can help us further narrow it down to a few variables which are causing the fluctuations.\n\nA change in the population distribution can be due to:\n\n- Changes in the economic environment like Recession, Covid-19 etc\n- Changes in the sources of data\n- Internal policy changes which impact the population distribution directly or indirectly\n- Issues in data integration which might result in erroneous data\n- Issues while programming/coding, such as model implementation or missing some crucial steps of the scoring code\n\n<https://www.listendata.com/2015/05/population-stability-index.html>\n\n<https://towardsdatascience.com/psi-and-csi-top-2-model-monitoring-metrics-924a2540bed8>\n\n- **Population Stability Index (PSI)**\n\nShows whether two populations differ with respect to a feature using discrete categories of the feature.\n\n## PSI can be used to assess whether the population of new loan applicants differ from the population of applicants on which the PD (Population Distribution) model was built\n\nPopulation Stability Index (PSI) compares the distribution of a scoring variable (predicted probability) in scoring data set to a training data set that was used to develop the model. The idea is to check \"How the current scoring is compared to the predicted probability from training data set\".\n\nIs the new data too different from the original one?\n\nActual data vs Excepted data\n\n![image](media/Course-Credit-Risk-Modeling_Intro-image8.png)\n\n![image](media/Course-Credit-Risk-Modeling_Intro-image9.png)\n\n## INTERPRETATION RULES\n\n1. PSI < 0.1: No change. You can continue using the existing model.\n\n2. PSI >=0.1:but less than 0.2 - Slight change is required.\n\n3. PSI >=0.2:Significant change is required. Ideally, we should not use this model anymore. It should be recalibrated/redeveloped.\n\n## CSI\n\nIt answers which variable is causing a shift in population distribution. It compares the distribution of anindependent variablein the scoring data set to a development data set. It detects shifts in the distributions of input variables that are submitted for scoring over time.\n\nIt helps to determine which changing variable is responsible majorly for causing the model score shift.\n\nWhen a model deteriorates in performance, checking distributional changes in the model variables can help with identifying possible causes. This is a step that is taken generally after one has checked PSI and it's not in the green zone (<0.1 in general) to check that the overall population distribution can be attributed majorly to which variables.\n\nAt least one variable that has changed significantly or if several variables have moved to some extent, it might be time to recalibrate or to rebuild the model.\n\n## LGD (Loss Given Default)\n\nthe percentage of the exposure that was lost after the borrower defaulted\n\n## EAD (Exposure At Default)\n\nthe amount of the exposure at the moment the borrower defaulted\n\nWhen building LGD and EAD models, it is a good practice to build models with data from borrowers that have had enough time to repay part of the remaining debt.\n\nFor the LGD and EAD models we need only data for: accounts that have been written-off and a sufficient amount of time has passed so there can be some recoveries.\n\nRecovery rate = recoveries / funded amount\n\nRecovery rate is the dependent variable for the LGD model\n\nRecovery rate is the proportion of the total exposure that can be recovered by the lender once a default has occurred.\n\n![image](media/Course-Credit-Risk-Modeling_Intro-image10.png)\n\nCCF - Credit Conversion Factor\n\nCCF is the proportion of total exposure at the moment of default.\n\nEAD = total funded amount * credit conversion factor\n\nWhat regression model is used most often to model recovery rate and credit conversion factors, and what modeling approaches do we apply instead? - The one used most often is beta regression, we apply logistic regression and linear regression.\n\nInterpretation of the coefficients: A coefficient shows the change in the dependent variable that is going to occur as a result of a unit change in the respective independent variable\n\nresiduals - difference between the actual and predicted values\n\nHow exactly do we combine the two models to calculate our final estimation for recovery rate?\n\nFor all accounts with predicted recovery rate 0 by the logistic regression model, we set estimated recovery rate to 0, and for all the rest, we use the recovery rate estimated by the linear regression model.\n\n## EAD Model\n\nThe dependent variable for the EAD model is the credit conversion factor (CCF): the proportion from the original amount of the loan that is still outstanding at the moment when the borrower defaulted.\n\nWhen performing regression analysis, a categorical variable with K categories is represented by only K-1 dummies.\n\nSo we have to leave one dummy variable for each categorical predictor to serve as a reference category, just like we did for LGD model\n\nPositive coefficients = Increase in the CCF (higher risk)\n\nNegative coefficients = Decrease in the CCF (lower risk)\n\nBased on the coefficients of the model, how much greater is the credit conversion factor expected to be for someone whose purpose of the loan is 'educational' than for someone whose purpose of the loan is 'credit card' (which is the reference category for the variable)? - about 0.09\n\nBased on the coefficients of the model, what would be the difference between the credit conversion factor for someone whose purpose of the loan 'educational' and for someone whose purpose of the loan 'moving'? - about 0.05 greater\n\nWe used the same criterion for model performance for the model from this lecture and the stage 2 model from the LGD models. If we had to compare the two models, based on this criterion, which one explains better the data it needs to explain? - The EAD model from this lecture\n\n## Expected Loss\n\nEL = PD *LGD* EAD\n\nAssuming all accounts are one portfolio, to calculate the total expected loss amount for this portfolio, we must: Apply the PD, EAD, and LGD models on each account, multiply the three outputs for each account, and sum across all accounts.\n","excerpt":"Intro Created: 2020-03-27 18:15:22 +0500 Modified: 2021-06-06 16:38:03 +0500 Credit Risk The likelihood that a borrower would not repay
