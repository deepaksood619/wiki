Numbers (primitive)\n2. Strings (primitive)\n3. Boolean (primitive)\n4. Null (trivial)\n\n   null is the absence of a value. It is an assignment value that can be assigned to a variable as a representation of 'no-value'.\n\n5. Undefined (trivial)\n\n   Undefined is the absence of a definition. It is used as the default value for uninitialized variables, function arguments that were not provided and missing properties of objects. Functions returnundefined when nothing has been explicitly returned.\n\n6. Object (composite) (Non-primitive)\n7. Symbol (ES6)\n\n**Falsy values:** \"\",0, null, undefined, NaN, false\n\n**Truthy values:** 'hello', '0', ' ', ([]), (function() {})\n\n## Comments\n\n`// and /**/`\n\n## Variables\n\n- Not starting with number\n- Can start with underscore and characters\n- Declared using var keyword\n- Untyped language ( var foo ) can hold value of any data type\n- Scope - Global and Local\n\n1. **var**\n\n   The variable statement declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.\n\n2. **let**\n\n   The let statement declares a block scope local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.\n\n   let allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. This is unlike the [var](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var) keyword, which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.\n\n3. **const**\n\n   Constants are block-scoped, much like variables defined using the [let](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) statement. The value of a constant cannot change through re-assignment, and it can't be redeclared.\n\n   This declaration creates a constant whose scopecan be either global or local to the blockin which it is declared. Global constants do not become properties of the window object, unlike [var](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var) variables. An initializer for a constant is required; that is, you must specify its value in the same statement in which it's declared (which makes sense, given that it can't be changed later).\n\n   Theconstdeclarationcreates a read-only reference to a value. It doesnotmean the value it holds is immutable, just that the variable identifier cannot be reassigned. For instance, in the case where the content is an object, this means the object's contents (e.g., its parameters) can be altered.\n\n   All the considerations about the \"[temporal dead zone](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let#Temporal_dead_zone_and_errors_with_let)\" apply to both [let](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) andconst.\n\n   A constant cannot share its name with a function or a variable in the same scope.\n\n| Keyword | Scope          | Hoisting | Can Be Reassigned | Can Be Redeclared |\n|---------|----------------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| var     | Function scope | Yes      | Yes               | Yes               |\n| let     | Block scope    | No       | Yes               | No                |\n| const   | Block scope    | No       | No                | No                |\n\n## Keywords\n\n| | | | |\n|----------|------------|------------|--------------|\n| abstract | else       | instanceof | switch       |\n| boolean  | enum       | int        | synchronized |\n| break    | export     | interface  | this         |\n| byte     | extends    | long       | throw        |\n| case     | false      | native     | throws       |\n| catch    | final      | new        | transient    |\n| char     | finally    | null       | true         |\n| class    | float      | package    | try          |\n| const    | for        | private    | typeof       |\n| continue | function   | protected  | var          |\n| debugger | goto       | public     | void         |\n| default  | if         | return     | volatile     |\n| delete   | implements | short      | while        |\n| do       | import     | static     | with         |\n| double   | in         | super      |             |\n\n## Operators\n\n1.

Its value is a string indicating the data type of the operand.\n\n8. in\n\n   The in operator returns true if the specified property is in the specified object or its prototype chain.\n\n   // Arrays\n   var trees = ['redwood', 'bay', 'cedar', 'oak', 'maple'];\n   0 in trees // returns true\n   3 in trees // returns true\n   6 in trees // returns false\n   'bay' in trees // returns false (you must specify the\n   // index number, not the value at that index)\n   'length' in trees // returns true (length is an Array property)\n   Symbol.iterator in trees // returns true (arrays are iterable, works only in ES2015+)\n\n   // Predefined objects\n   'PI' in Math // returns true\n\n   // Custom objects\n   var mycar = {make: 'Honda', model: 'Accord', year: 1998};\n   'make' in mycar // returns true\n   'model' in mycar // returns true\n\n## Control Statements\n\n1. If statement\n2. If-else statement\n3. If - else - if statement\n4. switch\n\nThe switch statement evaluates an [expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators), matching the expression's value to acaseclause, and executes [statements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements) associated with that case, as well as statements incases that follow the matching case.\n\n## Hoisting\n\nThe behavior of \"moving\"varandfunctiondeclarations to the top of their respective scopes during the compilation phase is calledhoisting.\n\nFunction declarations are completely hoisted. This means that a declared function can be called before it is defined.\n\nVariables are partially hoisted.vardeclarations are hoisted but not its assignments.\n\nlet and const are not hoisted.\n\nall variables (var) are declared at top of any function scope (includes function declaration)\n\n### var hoisting\n\nBecause variable declarations (and declarations in general) are processed before any code is executed, declaring a variable anywhere in the code is equivalent to declaring it at the top. This also means that a variable can appear to be used before it's declared. This behavior is called \"hoisting\", as it appears that the variable declaration is moved to the top of the function or global code.\n\n## Closure\n\nA closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment from which it was declared. Closure allows a function to access variables from an enclosing scope -environment--- even after it leaves the scope in which it was declared.\n\n## Immediate Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)\n\nA JS programming language idiom which produces a lexical scope using JS's function scoping. It can be used to avoid variable hoisting from within blocks, protect against polluting the global environment and simultaneously allow public access to methods while retaining privacy for variables defined within the function.\n\nAn IIFE is a function expression that is called immediately after you define it. It is usually used when you want to create a new variable scope.\n\nContextis most often determined by how a function is invoked. It always refers to the value ofthisin a particular part of your code.\n\nScope refers to the visibility of variables.\n\n`( function foo() { } )();`\n\n## When would you use an IIFE\n\nWhen we want to control the scope of variables of a function. This function will not be available globally to be called from.\n\n## Naming Conventions\n\nJSON Key must be used as camelCase or snake_case.\n\nGoogle follows camelCase\n\n## Boolean\n\nAny object of which the value is not [undefined](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined) or [null](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/null), including aBooleanobject whose value isfalse, evaluates totruewhen passed to a conditional statement. For example, the condition in the following [if](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else) statement evaluates to true:\n\n```js\nvar x = new Boolean(false);\nif (x) {\n// this code is executed\n}\n\nif (false) {\n   // this code is not executed\n}\n\nif (1) {\n   // this code is executed\n}\n\nif (0) {\n   // this code is not executed\n}\n```\n\n## String functions\n\n1. String.length\n2. String.prototype.split()\n3. String.prototype.replace()\n\n   - Ex - **str = str.replace(/[^a-z]*/g, \"\");**\n   - Ex - str = str.replace(/[^a-z0-9]*/g, \"\")\n\n4. String.prototype.toLowerCase()\n5. String.prototype.toUpperCase()\n6. String.prototype.slice()\n\n   ```js\n   var str =\"Hello world!\";\n   var res = str.slice(1,5); // ello\n   ```\n\n7. String.prototype.substr()\n\n   The **substr()** method returns the characters in a string beginning at the specified location through the specified number of characters.\n\n8. String.prototype.substring()\n\n   The **substring()** method returns a subset of astringbetween one index and another, or through the end of the string.\n\n9. String.prototype.indexOf()\n\n   The **indexOf()** method returns the index within the calling [String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) object of the first occurrence of the specified value, starting the search atfromIndex. Returns -1 if the value is not found.\n\n10. String.prototype.charCodeAt()\n\n   The **charCodeAt()** method returns an integer between 0 and 65535 representingthe UTF-16 code unit at the given index\n\n11. String.fromCharCode()\n\n   The static **String.fromCharCode()** method returns a string created from the specified sequence of UTF-16 code units.\n\n12. String.prototype.match()\n\n   The **match()** method retrieves the matches when matching a *string* against a *regular expression*.\n\nBracket notation for getting string characters\n\nStrings are immutable\n\n```js\nVar myStr = \"Bob\";\nmyStr [0] = \"J\"; // error\n```\n\n## Arrays\n\n1. Array.prototype.push()\n2. Array.prototype.pop()\n3. Array.prototype.shift()\n\nThe **shift()** method removes the **first** element from an array and returns that removed element. This method changes the length of the array.\n\n4. Array.prototype.unshift()\n5. Array.prototype.slice()\n6. Array.prototype.splice()\n\nThe **splice()** method changes the contents of an array by removing existing elements and/or adding new elements.\n\n*Syntax - array*.splice(*start [*, *deleteCount [*, *item1 [*, *item2 [*, *...]]]]*)\n\n7. Array.prototype.reverse()\n\n8. Array.prototype.join()\n\n9. Array.prototype.find()\n\nThe **find()** method returns the **value** of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. Otherwise [undefined](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined) is returned.\n\n```js\nfunction isBigEnough(element) {\n   return element >= 15;\n}\n\n[12, 5, 8, 130, 44].find(isBigEnough); // 130\n```\n\n10. Array.prototype.indexOf()\n\nThe**indexOf()** method returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present.\n\n11. Array.prototype.includes()\n\nThe **includes()** method determines whether an array includes a certain element, returningtrueorfalseas appropriate.\n\n12. Array.prototype.sort()\n\nThe **sort()** method sorts the elements of an array [*in place*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) and returns the array. The sort is not necessarily [stable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Stability). The default sort order is according to string Unicode code points.\n\n```js\nvar fruit = ['cherries', 'apples', 'bananas'];\nfruit.sort(); // ['apples', 'bananas', 'cherries']\n\nvar scores = [1, 10, 21, 2];\nscores.sort(); // [1, 10, 2, 21]\n// Note that 10 comes before 2,\n// because '10' is mix of two characters '1' and '0' so '10' is before '2' in Unicode code point order.\n\nvar things = ['word', 'Word', '1 Word', '2 Words'];\nthings.sort(); // ['1 Word', '2 Words', 'Word', 'word']\n// In Unicode, numbers come before upper case letters,\n// which come before lower case letters.\n\nvar numbers = [4, 2, 5, 1, 3];\nnumbers.sort(function(a, b) {\nreturn a - b;\n});\nconsole.log(numbers);\n```\n\n13. Array isArray()\n\n```js\nArray.isArray([1, 2, 3]); // true\nArray.isArray({foo: 123}); // false\nArray.isArray('foobar'); // false\nArray.isArray(undefined); // false\n```\n\n## Loops\n\n1. **For**\n\n   - **foreach**\n\nforeachis an method that is available only in Array objects. It allows you to iterate through elements of an array. When invoked it takes a callback function and invokes the callback once for every array element. The callback can access both index and value of the array elements.foreachis available only for looping arrays.\n\n2. **for in**\n\nfor inis used to loop through properties of an object. It can be any object.for inallows you to access the keys of the object but doesn't provide reference to the values. In JavaScript object properties themselves have internal properties. One of the internal properties is [[Enumerable]].for inwill only walkthrough a property if it has [[Enumerbale]]set totrue. It not used to iterate elements of an collection rather used to iterate properties of objects.\n\n3. **for....of**\n\nThe **for...ofstatement** creates a loop iterating over [iterable objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#The_iterable_protocol)(including the built-in [String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String), [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array), e.g. theArray-like [arguments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/arguments) or [NodeList](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList) objects, [TypedArray](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray), [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) and [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set), and user-defined iterables), invoking a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property of the object.\n\n2. **While**\n\n## Objects (JSON - JavaScript Object Notation)\n\n## Accessing Objects Properties with the\n\n1. **Dot Operator**\n2. **Bracket Notation**\n\n1. Arguments Object\n\nIt can be converted to a realArray:\n\n   ```js\n   var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments); // preferred\n   var args = [].slice.call(arguments);\n\n   // ES2015, does not work sometimes\n   const args = Array.from(arguments);\n   ```\n\n2. Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty() // true or false\n3. Object.keys()\n\n   ```js\n   Ex - {'foo':'bar'}\n\n   // For getting the key from an object's 1st value\n   Object.keys [foo](0); // foo\n\n   // For getting the value from an object\n   foo [Object.keys [foo](0)); // bar\n   ```\n\n4. Delete object key-value\n\n   `delete collection [key];`\n\n## Adding properties to objects\n\n```js\nobj.bark = \"bow-wow\" // dot notation\nobj [\"bark\"] = \"bow-wow\" // bracket notation\n```\n\n## Deleting properties from objects\n\n```js\ndelete obj.bark; // dot notation\ndelete obj [\"bark\"] // bracked notation\n```\n\n## Random function\n\n```js\nMath.random(); // from 0(inclusive) to 1(exclusive)\nWhole Number - Math.floor(Math.random() * 20); // from 0 to 19\nRange - Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min\n// from range min to max\n```\n\n## Regular Expressions\n\nUsed to find certain words or patterns inside of strings.\n\n- Ex - /the/gi\n- / is the start of the regular expression\n- \"the\" is the pattern we want to match\n- / is the end of the regular expression\n- \"g\" means global, which causes the pattern to return all matches in the string, not just the first one\n- \"i\" means that we want to ignore the case when searching for the pattern\n\n## Special selectors\n\nd - retreive digits\ns - white spaces (\" \"(space), r(carriage return), n(newline), t(tab), f(form feed))\nS - non-whitespace characters\n\nEx\n\n```js\nvar re = /^(1s?)?((d{3})|d{3})[s-]?d{3}[s-]?d{4}$/;\nreturn re.test(str);\n```\n\n## String.prototype.match()\n\n`str.match(re)`\n\n## Object Oriented and Functional Programming\n\n1. **Constructor**\n\n```js\nvar Car = function() {\n   this.wheels = 4;\n   this.engines = 1;\n   this.seats = 5;\n};\n```\n\n## this variable refers to the new object being created by the constructor\n\nSo when we write,\n\n`this.wheels = 4;`\n\ninside of the constructor we are giving the new object it creates a property called wheels with a value of 4.\n\n2. **Instances of objects**\n\n`var myCar = new Car()`\n\n3. **Parametrized Constructor**\n\n```js\nvar myCar = new Car(6, 3, 1)\nvar Car = function(wheels, seats, engines) {\nthis.wheels = wheels;\nthis.seats = seats;\nthis.engines = engines;\n};\n```\n\n4. **Map**\n\nThe map method is a convenient way to iterate through arrays. Here's an example usage:\n\n```js\nvar oldArray = [1, 2, 3];\nvar timesFour = oldArray.map(function(val){\nreturn val * 4;\n});\n\nconsole.log(timesFour); // returns [4, 8, 12]\nconsole.log(oldArray); // returns [1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nThe map method will iterate through every element of the array, creating a new array with values that have been modified by the callback function, and return it. Note that it does not modify the original array.\n\n5. **Reduce**\n\nThe array method reduce is used to iterate through an array and condense it into one value.\n\nTo use reduce you pass in a callback whose arguments are an accumulator (in this case, previousVal) and the current value (currentVal).\n\nThe accumulator is like a total that reduce keeps track of after each operation. The current value is just the next element in the array you're iterating through.\n\nreduce has an optional second argument which can be used to set the initial value of the accumulator. If no initial value is specified it will be the first array element and currentVal will start with the second array element.\n\nHere is an example of reduce being used to subtract all the values of an array:\n\n```js\nvar singleVal = array.reduce(function(previousVal, currentVal) {\nreturn previousVal - currentVal;\n}, 0);\n```\n\n6. **Filter**\n\nThe filter method is used to iterate through an array and filter out elements where a given condition is not true.\n\nfilter is passed a callback function which takes the current value (we've called that val) as an argument.\n\nAny array element for which the callback returns true will be kept and elements that return false will be filtered out.\n\nThe following code is an example of using filter to remove array elements that are equal to five:\n\nNote: We omit the second and third arguments since we only need the value\n\n```js\narray = array.filter(function(val) {\nreturn val !== 5;\n});\n```\n\n7. **Sort**\n\nYou can use the method sort to easily sort the values in an array alphabetically or numerically.\n\nUnlike the previous array methods we have been looking at, sort actually alters the array in place. However, it also returns this sorted array.\n\nsort can be passed a compare function as a callback. The compare function should return a negative number if ashould be before b, a positive number if a should be after b, or 0 if they are equal.\n\nIf no compare (callback) function is passed in, it will convert the values to strings and sort alphabetically.\n\nHere is an example of using sort with a compare function that will sort the elements from smallest to largest number:\n\n```js\nvar array = [1, 12, 21, 2];\narray.sort(function(a, b) {\nreturn a - b;\n});\n```\n\nUse sort to sort array from largest to smallest.\n\n8. **Reverse**\n\nYou can use the reverse method to reverse the elements of an array.\n\nreverse is another array method that alters the array in place, but it also returns the reversed array.\n\n```js\nvar myArray = [1, 2, 3];\nmyArray.reverse();\n// returns [3, 2, 1]\n```\n\n9. **Concat**\n\nconcat can be used to merge the contents of two arrays into one.\n\nconcat takes an array as an argument and returns a new array with the elements of this array concatenated onto the end.\n\nHere is an example of concat being used to concatenate otherArray onto the end of oldArray:\n\n`newArray = oldArray.concat(otherArray);`\n\n10. **Split**\n\nYou can use the split method to split a string into an array.\n\nsplit uses the argument you pass in as a delimiter to determine which points the string should be split at.\n\nHere is an example of split being used to split a string at every s character:\n\n`var array = string.split('s');`\n\n11. **Join**\n\nWe can use the join method to join each element of an array into a string separated by whatever delimiter you provide as an argument.\n\nThe following is an example of using join to join all of the elements of an array into a string with all the elements separated by word and:\n\n```js\nvar veggies = [\"Celery\", \"Radish\", \"Carrot\", \"Potato\"];\nvar salad = veggies.join(\" and \");\nconsole.log(salad); // \"Celery and Radish and Carrot and Potato\"\n```\n\n## Built-in functions\n\n### Conversion\n\n```js\nparseFloat('43.1')\nparseInt('45') // always use the floor value if float is passed\n```\n\n## Destructuring assignment / Spread operator\n\nThe destructuring assignmentsyntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.\n\n```js\n[a, b, ...rest] = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];\nconsole.log(rest);\n// expected output: Array [30,40,50]\n```\n\n<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment>\n\n<https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/array-vs-object-destructuring-in-javascript>\n\n## Spread Syntax\n\nSpread syntax(...) allows an iterable such as an array expression or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected, or an object expression to be expanded in places where zero or more key-value pairs (for object literals) are expected.\n\n<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax>\n\n<https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-object-destructuring-spread-operator-rest-parameter>\n\n- Object destructuring is new syntax introduced in ES6. It helps create variables by extracting the object's properties in a much simpler way.\n- If you are working with (or planning to use) a framework/library likeangular, react, orvue, you will be using a lot of object destructuring syntax.\n- Object destructuring and Spread syntax are not the same thing.\n- Spreadsyntax (also known as the Spread Operator) is used to copy the enumerable properties of an object to create a clone of it. We can also update an object or merge with another object using the spread syntax.\n- TheRestparameter is kind of the opposite of theSpreadsyntax. It helps to consolidate (or collect) the remaining object properties into a new object while destructuring is done.\n\n##
