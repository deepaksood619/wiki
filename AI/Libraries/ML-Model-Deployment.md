**Offline Deployment**

The model is deployed to an offline container and run in a Spark job to generate batch predictions either on demand or on a repeating schedule.



**Online Deployment**

The model is deployed to an online prediction service cluster (generally containing hundreds of machines behind a load balancer) where clients can send individual or batched prediction requests as network RPC calls.

**ML Lifecycle**
-   Framing ML problems from business goals
-   Access, prepare and process data for the model
-   Architect ML solution and develop ML models
-   Deploy ML models
-   Iterate - Monitor, optimize and maintain the performance of the model
