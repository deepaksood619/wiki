Chained hash table (Using linked list if collision)\n\nChainingis where each item in the hash table array is a list. When an item is added to the array at an index, it's added to corresponding list.\n![](media/Hashing-Techniques-image1.png)\n**Variants**\n-   Two-probe hashing\n    -   Hash to two positions, insert key in shorter of the two chains\n    -   Reduces expected length of the longest chain to log log N\n2.  **Open Addressing (closed hashing)**\n\nOpen addressinghandles collisions by searching for an empty slot in the array by following a deterministic sequence. This checking is known asprobing, and the sequence is known as a probing sequence. A simple probing sequence is to check each slot one after the other.\n![Collision! ](media/Hashing-Techniques-image2.png)\n\nThe benefits of this approach are:\n-   **Predictable memory usage\n    **No allocation of new nodes when keys are inserted\n-   **Less memory overhead\n    **No next pointers\n-   **Memory locality\n    **A linear memory layout provides better cache characteristics\nProbing techniques / Searching techniques / Search sequences\n\ni.  **Linear Probing -** Find next empty slot and put the key there\n\nii. **Double Hashing -** Use two hash functions, if there is collision on first hash, use second hash function to get the bucket address.\n\niii. **Quadratic probing -** Quadratic probing operates by taking the original hash index and adding successive values of an arbitrary[quadratic polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_polynomial)until an open slot is found.\n     -   Use linear probing, but skip a variable amount, not just 1 each time.\n     -   Effectively eliminates clustering\n     -   Can allow table to become nearly full\n     -   More difficult to implement delete\n![工 型 qnoa 61Jlqo 」 d 0 一 一 e 」 peno 6UlqOJd 」 2 ① u コ VVVVV ](media/Hashing-Techniques-image3.png)\n**Removal**\n-   Tombstones (Can create contamination)\n**Variants**\n-   Coalesced Hashing\n-   Cuckoo Hashing\n-   Robin Hood Hashing\n-   Hopscotch Hashing\n<https://programming.guide/hash-tables-open-addressing.html>\n3.  **Coalesced Hashing**\n\nCoalesced hashing is a technique for implementing a hash table. It's an[open addressing](https://programming.guide/hash-tables-open-addressing.html) technique which means that all keys are**stored in the array itself**(e.g. it doesn't use for example linked lists to handle collisions). As opposed to other open addressing techniques however, it also uses**nodes with next-poiners**to form collision chains.\n**Example:**Coalesced hash table holding five keys in two collision chains. (Keys of the same color hash to the same bucket.)\n\n![](media/Hashing-Techniques-image4.png)\n**Removal**\n-   clearing out a slot might break a chain, and cause future lookups to fail. To avoid this problem, one could instead use 'deleted' markings but this is subject to so called **contamination**.-   The approach commonly used in practice is to clear the slot holding the key, and then**reinsert**all following keys in the chain.\n-   This maintains the invariants, avoids contamination and potentially even breaks apart previously coalesced chains.\n**Cellar**\n\nA common optimization (so common in fact, that it is almost to be considered a part of the standard implementation) is to reserve part of the hash table array to be used only for storing colliding keys. This part is called**the cellar**.\n**Example:**A coalescing hash table array with*M* = 10and*N* = 3.\n\n![The addressable part: The slots to which keys can hash to.

As opposed to most other hash tables, it achieves**constant time worst-case complexity for lookups**.\nCollisions are handled by evicting existing keys and moving them from one array to the other.
