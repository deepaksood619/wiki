This technique was used in the preceeding example. A haghVaIue, tom O to - 1). is Ccmputed by dividing the key value by the size of the hash table and taking the remainder. For example: typedef int key) key HASH TABLE SIZE; Selecting an appropriate is important to the success ot this metht:xi. For example. a divisible by two yield even hash fcy even keys. and odd hash values for odd keys. This is an undesirable property. as all keys would hash to even values if trwy to be everL If HASH _ TABLE_SIZE is a of then the hash function simply selects a subset of the key bits as the table index.
