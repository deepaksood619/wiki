If that count is odd, the parity bit value is set to 1, making the total count of occurrences of 1s in the whole set (including the parity bit) an even number. If the count of 1s in a given set of bits is already even, the parity bit's value is 0.\nIn the case of odd parity, the coding is reversed. For a given set of bits, if the count of bits with a value of 1 is even, the parity bit value is set to 1 making the total count of 1s in the whole set (including the parity bit) an odd number. If the count of bits with a value of 1 is odd, the count is already odd so the parity bit's value is 0.\nEven parity is a special case of a[cyclic redundancy check](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check)(CRC), where the 1-bit CRC is generated by the[polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial)x+1.\nIf a bit is present at a point otherwise dedicated to a parity bit, but is not used for parity, it may be referred to as amark parity bitif the parity bit is always 1, or aspace parity bitif the bit is always 0. In such cases where the value of the bit is constant, it may be called astick parity biteven though its function has nothing to do with parity.The function of such bits varies with the system design, but examples of functions for such bits include timing management, or identification of a packet as being of data or address significance. If its actual bit value is irrelevant to its function, the bit amounts to a[don't-care term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t-care_term).\nParity bits are generally applied to the smallest units of a communication protocol, typically 8-bit[octets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octet_(computing))(bytes), although they can also be applied separately to an entire message string of bits.\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_bit>\n\n## Forward Error Correction**\n\nForward error correction (FEC) is an error correction technique to detect and correct a limited number of errors in transmitted data without the need for retransmission.\nIn this method, the sender sends a redundant error-correcting code along with the data frame. The receiver performs necessary checks based upon the additional redundant bits. If it finds that the data is free from errors, it executes error-correcting code that generates the actual frame. It then removes the redundant bits before passing the message to the upper layers.\n**Advantages and Disadvantages**\n-   Because FEC does not require handshaking between the source and the destination, it can be used for broadcasting of data to many destinations simultaneously from a single source.\n-   Another advantage is that FEC saves bandwidth required for retransmission. So, it is used in real time systems.\n-   Its main limitation is that if there are too many errors, the frames need to be retransmitted.\n**Error Correction Codes for FEC**\n\nError correcting codes for forward error corrections can be broadly categorized into two types, namely, block codes and convolution codes.\n-   **Block codes−** The message is divided into fixed-sized blocks of bits to which redundant bits are added for error correction.\n-   **Convolutional codes−** The message comprises of data streams of arbitrary length and parity symbols are generated by the sliding application of a Boolean function to the data stream.\nThere are four popularly used error correction codes.\n\n![Hamming Codes Binary Convolution Code Reed --- Solomon Code Low-Density Parity Check Code ](media/Forward-Error-Correction-image1.jpg)\n-   **Hamming Codes−** It is a block code that is capable of detecting up to two simultaneous bit errors and correcting single-bit errors.\nIn[telecommunication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication),Hamming codesare a family of[linear error-correcting codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_code). Hamming codes can detect up to two-bit errors or correct one-bit errors without detection of uncorrected errors. By contrast, the simple[parity code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_bit)cannot correct errors, and can detect only an odd number of bits in error. Hamming codes are[perfect codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_code), that is, they achieve the highest possible[rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_code#The_rate_R)for codes with their[block length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_code#The_block_length_n)and[minimum distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_code#The_distance_d)of three.[Richard W. Hamming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming)invented Hamming codes in 1950 as a way of automatically correcting errors introduced by[punched card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card)readers. In his original paper, Hamming elaborated his general idea, but specifically focused on the[Hamming(7,4)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming(7,4))code which adds three parity bits to four bits of data.\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code>-   **Binary Convolution Code−** Here, an encoder processes an input sequence of bits of arbitrary length and generates a sequence of output bits.\n-   **Reed-Solomon Code−** They are block codes that are capable of correcting burst errors in the received data block.\n-   **Low-Density Parity Check Code−** It is a block code specified by a parity-check matrix containing a low density of 1s. They are suitable for large block sizes in very noisy channels.\n![Error correction codes Hamming codes Reed-Solomon Turbo codes 1930 1940 950 codes 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 Shannon's paper on information theory Shor codes (quantum) ](media/Forward-Error-Correction-image2.png)\n\n<https://www.tutorialspoint.com/forward-error-correction-fec>\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_error_correction>\n\n[Hamming codes, h■w to ov■rco■e n■ise.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8jsijhllIA)\n![One Bit is Wrong (according to an extended Hamming Code) oooooooo Can you tell which? ](media/Forward-Error-Correction-image3.jpg)\n**Binary Goley Code**\n\nIn[mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics)and[electronics engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics_engineering), abinary Golay codeis a type of linear[error-correcting code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error-correcting_code)used in[digital communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_communication).
