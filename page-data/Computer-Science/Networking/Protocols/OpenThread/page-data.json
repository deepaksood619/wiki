extremely low power consumption and low latency.\n[Thread](http://threadgroup.org/)is an IPv6-based networking protocol designed for low-power Internet of Things devices in an IEEE 802.15.4-2006 wireless mesh network, commonly called a Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN). Thread is independent of other 802.15.4 mesh networking protocols, such a ZigBee, Z-Wave, and Bluetooth LE.\n\nThread's primary features include:\n-   Simplicity --- Simple installation, start up, and operation\n-   Security --- All devices in a Thread network are authenticated and all communications are encrypted\n-   Reliability --- Self-healing mesh networking, with no single point of failure, and spread-spectrum techniques to provide immunity to interference\n-   Efficiency --- Low-power Thread devices can sleep and operate on battery power for years\n-   Scalability --- Thread networks can scale up to hundreds of devices\n**Features**\n\nOpenThread implements all Thread networking layers (IPv6, 6LoWPAN, IEEE 802.15.4 with MAC security, Mesh Link Establishment, Mesh Routing) and device roles, as well as Border Router support.\n[APPLICATION SERVICES](https://openthread.io/reference/)\n-   IPv6 configuration and raw data interface\n-   UDP sockets\n-   CoAP client and server\n-   DHCPv6 client and server\n-   DNSv6 client\n\n[ENHANCED FEATURES](https://openthread.io/guides/build)\n-   Child Supervision\n-   Inform Previous Parent on Reattach\n-   Jam Detection\n-   Periodic Parent Search\n\n[NCP SUPPORT](https://openthread.io/guides/ncp/)\n-   [Spinel](https://github.com/openthread/openthread/tree/master/src/ncp), a general purpose NCP protocol\n-   [wpantund](https://github.com/openthread/wpantund), a user-space NCP network interface driver/daemon\n-   Sniffer support via NCP Spinel nodes\n\n[BORDER ROUTER](https://openthread.io/guides/border-router)\n-   Web UI for configuration and management\n-   Thread Border Agent to support an External Commissioner\n-   NAT64 for connecting to IPv4 networks\n-   Thread interface driver using wpantund\n**Node Roles and Types**\n\nIn a Thread network, nodes are split into two forwarding roles:\n\n**Router**\n\nA Router is a node that:\n-   forwards packets for network devices\n-   provides secure commissioning services for devices trying to join the network\n-   keeps its transceiver enabled at all times\n\n**End Device**\n\nAn End Device (ED) is a node that:\n-   communicates primarily with a single Router\n-   does not forward packets for other network devices\n-   can disable its transceiver to reduce power\n![OT Node Roles](media/OpenThread-image1.png)\n**Device Types**\n\n**Full Thread Device**\n\nA Full Thread Device (FTD) always has its radio on, subscribes to the all-routers multicast address, and maintains IPv6 address mappings. There are three types of FTDs:\n-   Router\n-   Router Eligible End Device (REED) --- can be promoted to a Router\n-   Full End Device (FED) --- cannot be promoted to a Router\n\nAn FTD can operate as a Router (Parent) or an End Device (Child).\n\n**Minimal Thread Device**\n\nA Minimal Thread Device does not subscribe to multicast traffic and forwards all messages to its Parent. There are two types of MTDs:\n-   Minimal End Device (MED) --- transceiver always on, does not need to poll for messages from its parent\n-   Sleepy End Device (SED) --- normally disabled, wakes on occasion to poll for messages from its parent\n\nAn MTD can only operate as an End Device (Child).\n![OT Device
