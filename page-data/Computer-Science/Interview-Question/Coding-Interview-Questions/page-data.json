Given [13, 19, 13, 13], return 19.\n\nDo this in O(N) time and O(1) space.\n**Question**\n\nGiven an array of strictly the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B',\n\nsegregate the values of the array so that all the Rs come first,\n\nthe Gs come second, and the Bs come last. You can only swap elements of the array.\nDo this in linear time and in-place.\nFor example, given the array ['G', 'B', 'R', 'R', 'B', 'R', 'G'],\n\nit should become ['R', 'R', 'R', 'G', 'G', 'B', 'B'].\n**Question**\n\nGiven a sorted list of integers, square the elements and give the output in sorted order.\n\nFor example, given [-9, -2, 0, 2, 3], return [0, 4, 4, 9, 81].\n**Question**\n\nWrite a function that prints the least integer that is not present in a given list and cannot be represented by the summation of the sub-elements of the list.\nE.g. Fora = [1,2,5,7]the least integer not represented by the list or a slice of the list is 4, and ifa = [1,2,2,5,7]then the least non-representable integer is 18.\n**Question**\n\nHow would you optimally calculate p^k, where k is a non-negative integer? What is the complexity of the solution?\nFirst, let's mention that the trivial solution has the complexity of O(k). The problem can be solved by squaring and multiplying.\nWe know that p^k = p^x * p^y if x+y=k. We also know that p^k = (p^a)^b if a*b=k.\nFor an even value of k, choosing a = 2 and b = k/2, thus having p^k = (p^2)^(k/2), will reduce the number of required multiplications almost in half. For an odd value of k, choosing x = 1 and y=k-1 will result in y being even, and we can then simply repeat the same process as for the even case. This allows us to define a recursive function:\n\nFUNCTION pow(base, exponent)\nIF exponent == 0\nRETURN 1\nELSE IF exponent is even\nRETURN pow(base * base, exponent / 2)\nELSE\nRETURN base * pow(base * base, (exponent - 1) / 2)\nEND IF\n\nThis solution results in a complexity of O(log k).\n**Others**\n\nTopological sort\n\nDag resolving (DAG)\n\nTraversals (BFS, DFS, Pre, Post, in)\n\nLongest Consecutive Sequence\n\nDAG\n\nLP Solver\n\nSubset sum\n-   N-Queen Problem\n-   Word Ladder Problem\n-   Knight's Tour Problem\nFind all subsets of a given set (recursion + dp)\n\nFind a sum in a subset\n\nPython | Get all substrings of given string\n\n<https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-get-all-substrings-of-given-string>\n\nEgg drop - <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/egg-dropping-puzzle-dp-11>\n\nFind number of duplets in a positive integer array without using space in O(n) time complexity (save the information in the same array using index)\n\nDjkstra's algo\n\nSudoku solver\n\nChess solver\nB+TREE\n\nFinding number of duplicates in an array\n\nPython collision resolution\n\nImplementing column oriented database on disk\n\nImplementing hash table\n\nImplementing LRU\n\nImplementing min stack (where minimum element can be fetched in o(1))\n\nImplementing queue using two stack\n\nImplementing stack using two queue\nFind the subsequence with largest sum of elements in an array\n\n<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3733251/find-the-subsequence-with-largest-sum-of-elements-in-an-array>\n\nMaximum product subarray\n\nBalanced parenthesis problem\n**Writing programming interview questions hasn't made me rich yet ... so I might give up and start trading Apple stocks all day instead.**\n\nFirst, I wanna know how much money Icould havemade yesterday if I'd been trading Apple stocks all day.\nSo I grabbed Apple's stock prices from yesterday and put them ina listcalledstock_prices, where:\n-   Theindicesare the time (in minutes) past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.\n-   Thevaluesare the price (in US dollars) of one share of Apple stock at that time.\nSo if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, that meansstock_prices[60] = 500.\nWrite an efficientfunctionthat takesstock_pricesand returnsthe best profit I could have made from one purchase and one sale of one share of Apple stock yesterday.\n\nFor example:\n\nstock_prices = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]\n\nget_max_profit(stock_prices)\n# Returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)\n\nNo \"shorting\"---you need to buy before you can sell.
