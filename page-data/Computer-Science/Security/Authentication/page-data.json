You only need a single factor to authenticate, with the most common being a password, so it's more vulnerable to phishing attacks and key loggers.\nIn addition to this, a recent[article](https://dataprot.net/statistics/password-statistics/)by DataProt showed that 78% of Gen-Z people utilize the same password for multiple services. This means that if an attacker gained access to one user account, they have a high probability of gaining access to others by simply using the same password.-   **2-Factor Authentication**\n\nThis method is more secure, as it comprises two factors of authentication -- typically something you know, for example username and password , plus something you have / own, for example a phone SMS or a security token.\nFor 2-factor authentication, you would enter a one-time SMS password sent to your device, or perhaps a linked authenticator app code and provide an ever-changing access code.\nAs you can imagine, this is a lot more secure than simply entering a password, or a single authentication credential. You would need to know the login credentials, as well as have access to the physical device for the second part.\n2-factor authentication has become very common amongst online services in recent years, and with many large companies it is the default authentication method. Many require that you setup 2-factor auth in order to even utilize the service.-   **Multi-Factor Authentication**\n\nGoing one step further to make your authentication process even more secure is having 3 or more factors. This form of authentication usually works on the premise of:\n-   something you know (username + password or a username + security question and answer)\n-   something you have (mobile phone sms, authenticator app, USB key)\n-   something you are (like a fingerprint / face recognition)\nFor these reasons, multi-factor authentication offers the most protection, as you would need to compromise multiple factors, and these factors are a lot more difficult to \"hack\" or replicate.\nThe downside to this method of authentication, and the reason it's not utilized in many average systems, is it can be cumbersome to setup and maintain. So the data / system you're protecting really has to justify the need for such security.\n**Types of Authentication**\n-   Cookie-Based authentication\n-   Token-Based authentication\n-   Third party access(OAuth, API-token)\n-   OpenId\n-   SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)\n**Basic Access Authentication (BA)**\n\nIn the context of an[HTTP](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/HTTP)transaction,basic access authenticationis a method for an[HTTP user agent](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/User_agent)(e.g. a[web browser](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Web_browser)) to provide a[user name](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/User_name)and[password](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Password)when making a request. In basic HTTP authentication, a request contains a header field in the form ofAuthorization: Basic < credentials >, where credentials is the[Base64](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Base64)encoding of ID and password joined by a single colon\nHTTP Basic authentication (BA) implementation is the simplest technique for enforcing[access controls](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Access_controls)to web resources because it does not require[cookies](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/HTTP_cookie), session identifiers, or login pages; rather, HTTP Basic authentication uses standard fields in the[HTTP header](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/HTTP_header).\nThe BA mechanism does not provide[confidentiality](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Information_security#Confidentiality)protection for the transmitted credentials. They are merely encoded with[Base64](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Base64)in transit and not[encrypted](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Encryption)or[hashed](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cryptographic_hash)in any way. Therefore, basic authentication is typically used in conjunction with[HTTPS](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/HTTPS)to provide confidentiality.\n\nBecause the BA field has to be sent in the header of each HTTP request, the web browser needs to[cache](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cache_(computing))credentials for a reasonable period of time to avoid constantly prompting the user for their username and password. Caching policy differs between browsers.\nThis is the simplest to implement and for some implementations can work well, however it requires transport level encryption as the user name and password are presented with ever request.\n<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Basic_access_authentication>\n\n## Digest Access Authentication**\n\nDigest access authenticationis one of the agreed-upon methods a[web server](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Web_server)can use to negotiate credentials, such as username or password, with a user's[web browser](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Web_browser). This can be used to confirm the identity of a user before sending sensitive information, such as online banking transaction history. It applies a[hash function](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hash_function)to the username and[password](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Password)before sending them over the network. In contrast,[basic access authentication](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Basic_access_authentication)uses the easily reversible[Base64](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Base64)encoding instead of hashing, making it non-secure unless used in conjunction with[TLS](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Transport_Layer_Security).\nTechnically, digest authentication is an application of[MD5](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/MD5)[cryptographic hashing](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cryptographic_hash)with usage of[nonce](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cryptographic_nonce)values to prevent[replay attacks](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Replay_attack). It uses the[HTTP](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)protocol.\n<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Digest_access_authentication>\n\n## Cookie-Based Authentication (Stateful)**\n\nThe client posts the login credential to the server, server verifies the credential and creates session id which is stored in server(state-full) and returned to client via set-cookie. On subsequent request the session id from the cookie is verified in the server and the request get processed. Upon logout session id will be cleared from both client cookie and server.\n\n![](media/Authentication-image1.png)\n\n**Flow**\n-   Enter login credentials\n-   Server verifies given credentials, creates a session and stores in database.\n-   Cookie + Session ID will be kept in client side(User browser)\n-   For consequent requests, session ID will be verified against database.\n-   Session will be destroyed from client and server side once the use logs out\nWhen a server receives an HTTP request in the response, it can send aSet-Cookie header. The browser puts it into a cookie jar, and the cookie will be sent along with every request made to the same origin in theCookieHTTP header.\n**Tips**\n-   HttpOnly Cookies - To mitigate the possibility of XSS attacks always use theHttpOnlyflag when setting cookies. This way they won't show up indocument.cookies.\n-   Signed Cookies - With signed cookies, a server can tell if a cookie was modified by the client.\n**Cons**\n-   The main disadvantage of using this authentication method is, server has to store all the session data for each and every user and increases the overhead in the server.\n-   Need to make extra effort to mitigate[CSRF attacks](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF))\n-   Incompatibility with REST - as it introduces a state into a stateless protocol\n**Token-Based Authentication (Stateless)**\n\nToken based authenticationis gaining in popularity because of the rise in single page applications (SPA) and statelessness (RESTful API's) of the application. There are different ways to implement token based authentication, we will focussing on most commonly used JSON Web Token(JWT). On receiving the credentials from client the server validates the credentials and generates a signed JWT which contains the user information. Note, the token will never get stored in server(stateless). On subsequent request the token will be passed to server and gets verified(decoded) in the server. The token can be maintained at client side in local storage, session storage or even in cookies.\n**Flow**\n-   User provides credentials\n-   Server verifies credentials and returns a signed token.\n-   Token is stored in client side\n-   Subsequent requests to the server will be sent with the token as authentication header (HTTP header).\n-   Server verifies the token (JSON web token) and return required data.\n-   Token is destroyed in client, once the user logs out.\n**Ex - JWT**\n**Third-party Access**\n\nIf we have a need to expose our API's outside of our system like third party app or even to access it from mobile apps we end up in two common ways to share the user information.Via*API-token*which is same as *JWT token*, where the token will be send via Authorization header which will get handled at API gateway to authenticate the user. And the other option is via*Open Authentication(OAuth)*, OAuthis a protocol that allows an application to authenticate against server as a user. The recommendation is to implement OAuth 1.0a or OAuth 2.0. OAuth 2.0 relies on HTTPS for security and it currently implemented by Google, Facebook, Twitter etc., OAuth 2 provides secured delegate access to a resource based on user. OAuth 2 does this by allowing a token to be issued by Identity provider to these third party applications, with the approval of user. The client then uses the token to access the resource on behalf of that user.\n**SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)**\n\nMakes use of the same Identity provider which we saw in OpenId, but it is XML based and more flexible. The recommended version for SAML is 2.0. SAML also provides a way to achieve Single SignOn(SSO), user can make use of the Identity provider URL to login into the system which redirects with XML data back to your application page which can then be decoded to get the user information. We have SAML providers like G Suite, Office 365, OneLogin, Okta etc.,\nSAML is an XML-based open-standard for transferring identity data between two parties: an identity provider (IdP) and a service provider (SP).\n\nIdentity Provider--- Performs authentication and passes the user's identity and authorization level to the service provider.\n\nService Provider--- Trusts the identity provider and authorizes the given user to access the requested resource.\n**Benefits**\n-   Improved User Experience:Users only need to sign in one time to access multiple service providers.\n-   Increased Security:SAML provides a single point of authentication, which happens at a secure identity provider, SAML provider can apply context-based policies to access applications.\n-   Loose Coupling of Directories:SAML doesn't require user information to be maintained and synchronized between directories.\n-   Reduced Costs for Service Providers:With SAML, you don't have to maintain account information across multiple services. The identity provider bears this burden.\n<https://duo.com/blog/the-beer-drinkers-guide-to-saml>\n\n## Tricks**\n-   For Single SignOn OpenId has taken most of the consumer market, SAML is often the choice for many enterprise application.\n-   If you have to support only web application go for Cookie or Token based authentication.\n-   If you have to support both web as well mobile client go with API-token with that of Cookie based authentication.\n-   On top of above authentication methods if needed we can also implement One Time Password(OTP), Two Factor Authentication(2FA), Email verification etc.,\n**SSO**\n\n[Single Sign On Authentication](https://auth0.com/blog/what-is-and-how-does-single-sign-on-work/)provides your users with a seamless authentication experience when they navigate either through the applications you have built and/or third party apps. That is once you log into one of these applications, you won't have to enter your credentials again when entering another one, as you will be automatically logged in all of them, regardless of the platform, technology, or domain. Don't make your internal employees nor your external users go through the hassle of maintaining and remembering yet another credential.\nSingle Sign On works by having acentral server, which all the applications trust. When you login for the first time a cookie gets created on this central server. Then, whenever you try to access a second application, you get redirected to the central server, if you already have a cookie there, you will get redirected directly to the app with a token, without login prompts, which means you're already logged in.\nFor example, Google implements Single Sign On in its services. Google's central server is[https://accounts.google.com](https://accounts.google.com/). Once you are logged in this server, you will be able to accessGmail,Youtube, andGoogle Docswithout entering your credentials again.\n**WHAT IS MULTIFACTOR AUTHENTICATION?**\n\nMultifactor authentication (MFA) is a method of identifying users by presenting several separate authentication stages. Some of those stages could be Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP), Mobile verification, a hardware token, among others. 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) is the most used type of MFA.\n<https://auth0.com/learn/multifactor-authentication>\nIdP - Identity Provider\n\n**IAM - Identity and Access Management**\n-   [ORY Hydra](https://www.ory.sh/)\n\n<https://www.ory.sh>\n\n<https://github.com/ory/hydra>-   [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/)\n-   Okta\n-   Auth0\n-   Supertokens\n\n<https://supertokens.io>\n-   **jumpcloud (Oyster)**\n\n<https://jumpcloud.com/daas-glossary/identity-management>\n-   <https://magic.link>\n<https://withblue.ink/2020/04/08/stop-writing-your-own-user-authentication-code.html>\n\n## Signed Request**\n\nRequest signing is the process to add authentication information to Credit Saison India requests sent by HTTP.\nFor security, all requests to Credit Saison India must be signed with your credentials, which consists of an Client ID and Client Secret.

To get started with the signing process, see[Signing Credit Saison India Requests](http://ksf-documentation.s3-website.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/#authentication-signing-credit-saison-india-requests)\n1.  Generate a Hash of your Request Body. Encode the body of your request using UTF-8 and generate a hash for it using the SHA256 algorithm and then converting into a Hex Digest. The Output would then be standardised into Uppercase. This would be calledH1\n\nNote: If your request contains no body. Your signature should be a hash of the Litral `null`\n2.  Adding a TimeStamp to the the request. Using this Credit Saison India's Servers would validate that the requet that has been sent by you has been recieved by us with 10 minutes of your application having sent it.\n    The TimeStamp needs to be in the[UNIX Time](http://unixtimestamp.50x.eu/about.php)milliseconds (13-digit) format. Denoted assignedDateand added to the reqest as a query parameter.\n3.  Create a Canonical Request to generate the Signature. Arrange the contents of your request (host, action, headers, etc.) into a standard (canonical) format. A Canonical request is just the representation of the all parts of a request in a single string seperated using annew line character. We will call this canonical request asC1.\n\nNote: We would not be using the header as part of the canonical request\n\nNote: All query parameters need to be URL Encoded\nQuery parameters needs to be in a sorted in an acending order while generating the canonical request\n4.  Generate a hash of the canonical request. Similar to Step 1 here we create a SHA256 Hash of C1 by first converting it to UTF-8 encoded string and then hashing it. We will call this hash asH2.\n5.
