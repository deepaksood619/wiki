That is to say, it can always get the answer for \\\"Have the contents of this token been manipulated\\\"? This means user manipulation of the JWT token is futile because the server will know and disregard the token. The server adds a signature based on the payload when issuing a token to the client.

This keeps JWT small in size and avoids inadvertent information leakage because everyone knows not to keep sensitive data in JWT.\\nIt's not too different from how cookies themselves work. Cookies often contain unencrypted payloads. If you are using HTTPS then everything is good. If you aren't then it's advisable to encrypt sensitive cookies themselves. Not doing so will mean that a man-in-the-middle attack is possible--a proxy server or ISP reads the cookies and then replays them later on pretending to be you.

Only then we have a really secure system.\\nThe signing algorithm takes the header, the payload, and the secret to create a unique signature.

When tokens are signed using public/private key pairs, the signature also certifies that only the party holding the private key is the one that signed it.\n**When should you use JSON Web Tokens?**\n-   **Authorization:** This is the most common scenario for using JWT. Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. Single Sign On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays, because of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used across different domains.\n-   **Information Exchange:** JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties. Because JWTs can be signed---for example, using public/private key pairs---you can be sure the senders are who they say they are. Additionally, as the signature is calculated using the header and the payload, you can also verify that the content hasn't been tampered with.\nJWT consists of three parts (seperated by \".\"):\n-   **Header**, containing the type of the token and the hashing algorithm\n\nTheheadertypically consists of two parts: the token's type, and the hashing algorithm that is being used.\n\n{\n\n\"alg\": \"HS256\",\n\n\"typ\": \"JWT\"\n\n}-   **Payload**, containing the claims\n\n{\n\n\"sub\": \"65165751325\",\n\n\"name\": \"Rajat S\",\n\n\"admin\": true\n\n}-   **Signature**, which can be calculated as follows if you chose HMAC SHA256:HMACSHA256( base64UrlEncode(header) + \".\" + base64UrlEncode(payload), secret)\n\nThesignatureis used to verify that the message was not altered before reaching its destination. This is usually done by using private keys.\nThese three parts are usually encoded into three Base64-URI strings that are separated by a.in between them.\n![Browser POST (login with username + password Return JWT to the browser Send JWT in Authorization header Send response to client Server Create JWT with secret Check JWT signature with secret. Get user info from JWT ](media/Authentication_JWT-image1.png)\n\n**Payload**\n\nThe second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims:registered,public, andprivateclaims.\n-   [Registered claims](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1): These are a set of predefined claims which are not mandatory but recommended, to provide a set of useful, interoperable claims. Some of them are:iss(issuer),exp(expiration time),sub(subject),aud(audience), and[others](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1).\n\nNotice that the claim names are only three characters long as JWT is meant to be compact.\nThe JWT specification defines some registered claim names and defines how they should be used. PyJWT supports these registered claim names:\n-   \"exp\" (Expiration Time) Claim\n-   \"nbf\" (Not Before Time) Claim\n-   \"iss\" (Issuer) Claim\n-   \"aud\" (Audience) Claim\n-   \"iat\" (Issued At) Claim\n\n-   [Public claims](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.2): These can be defined at will by those using JWTs. But to avoid collisions they should be defined in the[IANA JSON Web Token Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml)or be defined as a URI that contains a collision resistant namespace.-   [Private claims](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.3): These are the custom claims created to share information between parties that agree on using them and are neitherregisteredorpublicclaims.\nAn example payload could be:\n\n{\n\"sub\": \"1234567890\",\n\"name\": \"John Doe\",\n\"admin\": true\n}\n\nThe payload is thenBase64Urlencoded to form the second part of the JSON Web Token.\nDo note that for signed tokens this information, though protected against tampering, is readable by anyone. Do not put secret information in the payload or header elements of a JWT unless it is encrypted.\n**RFCs**\n-   JWT - JSON Web Token\n-   JWS - JSON Web Signature\n-   JWE - JSON Web Encryption\n-   JWK - JSON Web Key\n-   JWA - JSON Web Algorithms\n<https://jwt.io>\n\n<https://jwt.io/introduction>\n\n<https://medium.com/@rahulgolwalkar/pros-and-cons-in-using-jwt-json-web-tokens-196ac6d41fb4>\n\n<https://gist.github.com/deepaksood619/4cc5656a42158927ca6006a1ec7d5eea>\n\n<https://www.pingidentity.com/en/company/blog/posts/2019/jwt-security-nobody-talks-about.html>\n\n<https://auth0.com/learn/json-web-tokens>\n\n[OAuth Vs JWT | What is the difference? | Tech Primers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9R3Gq1BKxI)\n\n[What Is JWT and Why Should You Use JWT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q17ubqLfaM)\n\n[100% Stateless with JWT (JSON Web Token) by Hubert Sablonnière](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67mezK3NzpU&t=24s&ab_channel=Devoxx)\n**If you can decode JWT, how are they secure?**\n\nJWTs can be either signed, encrypted or both. If a token is signed, but not encrypted, everyone can read its contents, but when you don't know the private key, you can't change it. Otherwise, the receiver will notice that the signature won't match anymore.\nThe short answer is that JWT doesn't concern itself with encryption. It cares about validation. That is to say, it can always get the answer for \"Have the contents of this token been manipulated\"? This means user manipulation of the JWT token is futile because the server will know and disregard the token. The server adds a signature based on the payload when issuing a token to the client. Later on it verifies the payload and matching signature.\nThe logical question is what is the motivation for not concerning itself with encrypted contents?\n\n1.  The simplest reason is because it assumes this is a solved problem for the most part. If dealing with a client like the web browser for example, you can store the JWT tokens in a cookie that issecure(is not transmitted via HTTP, only via HTTPS) andhttpOnly(can't be read by Javascript) and talks to the server over an encrypted channel (HTTPS). Once you know you have a secure channel between the server and client you can securely exchange JWT or whatever else you want.\n\n2.  This keeps thing simple. A simple implementation makes adoption easier but it also lets each layer do what it does best (let HTTPS handle encryption).\n\n3.  JWT isn't meant to store sensitive data. Once the server receives the JWT token and validates it, it is free to lookup the user ID in its own database for additional information for that user (like permissions, postal address, etc). This keeps JWT small in size and avoids inadvertent information leakage because everyone knows not to keep sensitive data in JWT.\nIt's not too different from how cookies themselves work. Cookies often contain unencrypted payloads. If you are using HTTPS then everything is good. If you aren't then it's advisable to encrypt sensitive cookies themselves. Not doing so will mean that a man-in-the-middle attack is possible--a proxy server or ISP reads the cookies and then replays them later on pretending to be you. For similar reasons, JWT should always be exchanged over a secure layer like HTTPS.\n**How it works**\n\nThe token is created using asecret stringthat isstored on a server. Next, the server then sends that JWT back to the client which will store it either in a cookie or in local storage.\nSo the server does in fact not know which user is actually logged in, but of course, the user knows that he's logged in because he has a valid Json Web Token which is a bit like a passport to access protected parts of the application.\nAll this communication must happen over https, so secure encrypted Http in order to prevent that anyone can get access to passwords or Json Web Tokens. Only then we have a really secure system.\nThe signing algorithm takes the header, the payload, and the secret to create a unique signature. So only this data plus the secret can create this signature, all right? Then together with the header and the payload, these signature forms the JWT, which then gets sent to the client.\nStore your JWT in cookies for web applications, because of the additional security they provide, and the simplicity of protecting against CSRF with modern web frameworks. HTML5 Web Storage is vulnerable to XSS, has a larger attack surface area, and can impact all application users on a successful attack.\n<https://stormpath.com/blog/where-to-store-your-jwts-cookies-vs-html5-web-storage>\n\n<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27301557/if-you-can-decode-jwt-how-are-they-secure>\n\n## pyjwt**\n\nPyJWTis a Python library which allows you to encode and decode JSON Web Tokens (JWT). JWT is an open, industry-standard ([RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)) for representing claims securely between two parties.\n$ pip install pyjwt\n>>> encoded_jwt = jwt.encode({\"some\":
