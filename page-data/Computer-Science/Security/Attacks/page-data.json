Passive Attack\n\nThey are having the nature of eavesdropping or monitoring of transmitting channel or packet sniffing\n-   Release of Message Content\n-   Traffic analysis used by intruder to gain the information\n\n2.  Active Attack\n\nInvolves some modification of data stream or creation of false stream\n-   Masquerade\n-   Replay\n-   Modification\n-   Repudiation\n-   Denial of Service\n**Return to Libc Attack (Buffer/Heap overflow attack)**\n\nIt is a[computer security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security)attack usually starting with a[buffer overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow)in which a subroutine[return address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_statement)on a[call stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack)is replaced by an address of a subroutine that is already present in the process' executable memory, bypassing the[NX bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NX_bit)feature (if present) and ridding the attacker of the need to inject their own code.-   Modify the return address to point to some function already residing in memory. (This works because single stack is shared by all functions of a process (library or user program)).\nSmashing the Stack for Fun and Profit by Aleph One\n**MITM Attack (Meet in the Middle Attack)**\n\nMITM attack attempts to find a value using both of the range (ciphertext) and domain (plaintext) of the composition of several functions (or block cipher) such that forward mapping through the first functions is the same as backward mapping (inverse image) through the last functions, quite literally meeting in the middle of the composed function.\nThe Multidimensional MITM (MD-MITM) uses a combination of several simultaneous MITM-attacks as described above, where the meeting happens in the multiple positions in the composed function.\n[Man in the Middle & Needham--Schroeder Protocol - Computerphile](https://youtu.be/EtpdLBeIaus)\n**Return Oriented Programming**\n\nA technique by which an attacker can induce arbitrary behavior in a program whose control flow he has diverted - without injecting any code.

This bypass of the isolation between DRAM memory cells results from the high cell density in modern DRAM, and can be triggered by specially crafted[memory access patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_access_pattern)that rapidly activate the same memory rows numerous times. While cell charge leakage is normal and mitigated by refreshes, additional leakage occurs during a rowhammer attack which causes cells to leak enough charge to change its content within a refresh interval.\nThe row hammer effect has been used in some[privilege escalation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation)computer security[exploits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploit_(computer_security)),and network-based attacks are also theoretically possible in a fast network connection between the attacker and victim.\nDifferent hardware-based techniques exist to prevent the row hammer effect from occurring, including required support in some[processors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit)and types of DRAM[memory modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_module).[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_hammer#cite_note-intel-d2s2e4-9)[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_hammer#cite_note-memcon-net105-10)Row hammer rarely or never affects[DDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR_SDRAM)and[DDR2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR2_SDRAM)SDRAM modules[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)]. It affects many[DDR3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR3_SDRAM)and[DDR4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR4_SDRAM)SDRAM modules.\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_hammer>\n\n## HTTP Desync**\n\nApplication Load Balancer (ALB) and Classic Load Balancer (CLB) now support HTTP Desync Mitigation Mode, a new feature that protects your application from issues due to HTTP Desync. Modern day web applications are typically built with a chain of proxies that ensure fast and reliable communication between clients and servers. While these proxies follow a standard mechanism to parse RFC 7230 compliant HTTP/1.1 requests, they may have differences in interpretation while parsing non-compliant requests. These differences in interpretation can cause Desync where different proxies in the chain may disagree on request boundaries and therefore may not process the same request. This could leave behind arbitrary messages that may be prepended to the next request in the queue and smuggled to the backend. Ultimately, request smuggling can make applications vulnerable to request queue or cache poisoning, which could lead to credential hijacking or execution of unauthorized commands.\n<https://portswigger.net/research/http-desync-attacks-request-smuggling-reborn>\n\n## Man-in-the-Middle attack (MITM)**\n\nA[man-in-the-middle attack](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/man-in-the-middle-attack)is one in which the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. One example is active eavesdropping, in which the attacker makes independent connections with the victims and relays messages between them to make them believe they are talking directly to each other over a private connection, when in fact the entire conversation is controlled by the attacker, who even has the ability to modify the content of each message. Often abbreviated to**MITM,MitM, orMITMA,** and sometimes referred to as asession hijacking attack, it has a strong chance of success if the attacker can impersonate each party to the satisfaction of the other. MITM attacks pose a serious threat to online security because they give the attacker the ability to capture and manipulate sensitive information in real-time while posing as a trusted party during transactions, conversations, and the transfer of data. This is straightforward in many circumstances; for example, an attacker within reception range of an unencrypted WiFi access point, can insert himself as a man-in-the-middle.\n","excerpt":"Attacks
