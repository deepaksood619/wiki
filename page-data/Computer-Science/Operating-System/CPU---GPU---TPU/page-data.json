21:55:49 +0500\n\n---\n\nMAC - Multiplier, Adder, Accumulator\n\nTensor - n-dimensional array\n\nSpecifically for matrix operations\n**CPU / GPU**\n-   A CPU is a scalar machine, which means it processes instructions one step at a time.\n-   A GPU is composed of hundreds of cores that can handle thousands of threads simultaneously.\n    -   Thats because GPUs were designed for 3d game rendering, which often involves parallel operations -The ability of a GPU with 100+ cores to process thousands of threads can accelerate some software by 100x over a CPU alone.\n    -   What's more, the GPU achieves this acceleration while being more power- and cost-efficient than a CPU.\n    -   So when neural networks run on GPUs, they run much faster than on CPUs\n-   ![alt text](media/CPU---GPU---TPU-image1.jpg)\n-   A GPU is a vector machine. You can give it a long list of data --- a 1D vector --- and run computations on the entire list at the same time.\n-   This way, we can perform more computations per second, but we have to perform the same computation on a vector of data in parallel.\n-   GPUs are general purpose chips. They don't just perform matrix operations, they can really do any kind of computation.\n-   GPUs are optimized for taking huge batches of data and performing the same operation over and over very quickly\n**TPU**\n-   TPU hardware is comprised of four independent chips.\n-   Each chip consists of two compute cores called Tensor Cores.\n-   A Tensor Core consists of scalar, vector and matrix units (MXU).\n-   In addition, 8 GB of on-chip memory (HBM) is associated with each Tensor Core.\n-   The bulk of the compute horsepower in a Cloud TPU is provided by the MXU.\n-   Each MXU is capable of performing 16K multiply-accumulate operations in each cycle.\n-   While the MXU's inputs and outputs are 32-bit floating point values, the MXU performs multiplies at reduced bfloat16 precision.\n-   Bfloat16 is a 16-bit floating point representation that provides better training and model accuracy than the IEEE half-precision representation. -From a software perspective, each of the 8 cores on a Cloud TPU can execute user computations (XLA ops) independently.\n-   High-bandwidth interconnects allow the chips to communicate directly with each other.-   ![alt text](media/CPU---GPU---TPU-image2.png)\n\n**The Systolic Array**\n-   The way to achieve that matrix performance is through a piece of architecture called a systolic array.\n-   This is the interesting bit, and it's why a TPU is performant.\n-   A systolic array is a kind of hardware algorithm, and it describes a pattern of cells on a chip that computes matrix multiplication.\n-   \"Systolic\" describes how data moves in waves across the chip, like the beating of a human heart.\n\n![alt text](media/CPU---GPU---TPU-image3.png)\n**Use Cases**\n\nCPUs:\n-   Quick prototyping that requires maximum flexibility\n-   Simple models that do not take long to train\n-   Small models with small effective batch sizes\n-   Models that are dominated by custom TensorFlow operations written in C++\n-   Models that are limited by available I/O or the networking bandwidth of the host system\n\nGPUs:\n-   Models that are not written in TensorFlow or cannot be written in TensorFlow\n-   Models for which source does not exist or is too onerous to change\n-   Models with a significant number of custom TensorFlow operations that must run at least partially on CPUs\n-   Models with TensorFlow ops that are not available on Cloud TPU (see the list of available TensorFlow ops)\n-   Medium-to-large models with larger effective batch sizes\n\nTPUs:\n-   Models dominated by matrix computations\n-   Models with no custom TensorFlow operations inside the main training loop\n-   Models that train for weeks or months\n-   Larger and very large models with very large effective batch sizes\n**CPU Time**\n\n<https://dzone.com/articles/nice-cpu-time-ni-time-in-top>\n","excerpt":"CPU | GPU | TPU Created: 2018-10-07 14:50:15 +0500 Modified: 2022-08-10 21:55:49 +0500 MAC - Multiplier,
