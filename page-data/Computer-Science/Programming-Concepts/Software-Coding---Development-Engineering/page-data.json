He suggests devising and implementing the main and subprograms right at the beginning, filling in the working sub-sections later. He believes that programming this way excites the engineers and provides a working system at every stage of development.\\nBrooks goes on to argue that there is a difference between \\\"good\\\" designers and \\\"great\\\" designers.

Only, your water hose is busted so you need to go down to the hardware store to get a new hose.\n-   To get to the hardware store, you have to drive across a bridge. The bridge requires a pass or ticket. You can't find your pass, but you know your neighbor has one.\n-   However, your neighbor won't lend you his pass until you return a pillow that you borrowed. The reason you haven't returned it is because the pillow is missing some stuffing.\n-   The pillow was originally stuffed with yak hair. In order to re-stuff the pillow you need to get some new yak hair.\n-   And that's how you end up shaving a yak, when all you really wanted to do was wax your car.\n**SLAP - Single Level of Abstraction Principle**\n![Three stages](media/Software-Coding---Development-Engineering-image2.png)\n**Legacy code**\n\nOne of the definitions - The code without test cases.\n**Greenfield code**\n\nIn many disciplines agreenfield projectis one that lacks constraints imposed by prior work. The analogy is to that of construction on[greenfield land](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_land)where there is no need to work within the constraints of existing buildings or infrastructure.\nIn[software development](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development), a greenfield project could be one of developing a system for a totally new environment, without concern for integrating with other systems, especially not[legacy systems](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system). Such projects are deemed as higher risk, as they are often for new infrastructure, new customers, and even new owners. For this reason,[agile software development](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)is often deemed the best approach, as it proposes how to handle those risks by developing small slices of complete functionality and getting them in the hands of customers (internal or external) quickly for immediate feedback.\n**Brownfield code**\n\nThose facilities which are modified/upgraded are called[brownfield land](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownfield_land)projects (often the pre-existing site/facilities are contaminated/polluted.)\nBrownfield development is a term commonly used in the IT industry to describe problem spaces needing the development and deployment of new software systems in the immediate presence of existing (legacy) software applications/systems. This implies that any new software architecture must take into account and coexist with live software already in situ.\n**Self Contained System (SCS)**\n\nThe Self-contained System (SCS) approach is an architecture that focuses on a separation of the functionality into many independent systems, making the complete logical system a collaboration of many smaller software systems. This avoids the problem of large monoliths that grow constantly and eventually become unmaintainable.\n\n<https://scs-architecture.org>\n[**http://engineering-principles.onejl.uk/**](http://engineering-principles.onejl.uk/)\n-   ARCHITECTURE\n    -   [Build Differentiators](http://engineering-principles.onejl.uk/architecture/Build_Differentiators.html)\n    -   [Design for Emergent Reuse](http://engineering-principles.onejl.uk/architecture/Design_for_Emergent_Reuse.html)\n    -   [Evolutionary Systems](http://engineering-principles.onejl.uk/architecture/Evolutionary_Systems.html)\n    -   [Scale Horizontally](http://engineering-principles.onejl.uk/architecture/Scale_Horizontally.html)\n    -   [Small and Simple](http://engineering-principles.onejl.uk/architecture/Small_and_Simple.html)\n    -   [Smarts in the Nodes not the Network](http://engineering-principles.onejl.uk/architecture/Smarts_in_the_Nodes_not_the_Network.html)\n-   OPERATIONAL\n    -   [Cloud Native](http://engineering-principles.onejl.uk/operational/Cloud_Native.html)\n    -   [Data Stewardship](http://engineering-principles.onejl.uk/operational/Data_Stewardship.html)\n    -   [Production Ready](http://engineering-principles.onejl.uk/operational/Production_Ready.html)\n-   ORGANISATION\n    -   [Keep Pace with Technological Change](http://engineering-principles.onejl.uk/organisation/Keep_Pace_with_Technological_Change.html)\n    -   [Model the Business Domain](http://engineering-principles.onejl.uk/organisation/Model_the_Business_Domain.html)\n-   TECHNOLOGY & PRACTICES\n    -   [Secure by Design](http://engineering-principles.onejl.uk/practices/Secure_by_Design.html)\n    -   [Automate by Default](http://engineering-principles.onejl.uk/practices/Automate_by_Default.html)\n    -   [Consistent Environments](http://engineering-principles.onejl.uk/practices/Consistent_Environments.html)\n    -   [Understandability](http://engineering-principles.onejl.uk/practices/Understandability.html)\n    -   [Performance Importance](http://engineering-principles.onejl.uk/practices/Performance_Importance.html)\n    -   [Get Feedback Early and Often](http://engineering-principles.onejl.uk/practices/Get_Feedback_Early_and_Often.html)\n    -   [Design for Testability](http://engineering-principles.onejl.uk/practices/Testability.html)\n**Lean Software Development**\n-   Eliminate Waste\n-   Build Quality In\n-   Create Knowledge\n-   Defer Commitment\n-   Deliver Fast\n-   Respect People\n-   Optimize the Whole\n**OCL (Object Constraint Language)**\n**UML (Unified Modeling Language)**\n\nUnified Modelling Language (UML)is a modeling language in the field of software engineering which aims to set standard ways to visualize the design of a system. UML guides the creation of multiple types of diagrams such as interaction , structure and behaviour diagrams.\n**Types of UML**\n-   Interaction diagram\n\nAn interaction diagram is used to show theinteractive behaviorof a system. Since visualizing the interactions in a system can be a cumbersome task, we use different types of interaction diagrams to capture various features and aspects of interaction in a system.\n-   Sequence diagram\n\nA sequence diagram simply depicts interaction between objects in a sequential order i.e. the order in which these interactions take place. We can also use the terms event diagrams or event scenarios to refer to a sequence diagram. Sequence diagrams describe how and in what order the objects in a system function. These diagrams are widely used by businessmen and software developers to document and understand requirements for new and existing systems.\n\n![1 : Open Application 2 : Access Webcam 3 : Get Photo 4 : Detect face 5 : Retrieve Mood 7 : Display Mood 6 : Mood 8 : Retrieve Music 10 : Playlist 9 : Generated Playlist ](media/Software-Coding---Development-Engineering-image3.png)\n\n<https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/unified-modeling-language-uml-sequence-diagrams>-   Flowchart\n-   Usecase diagram\n-   Class diagram\n-   Activity diagram\n-   Component diagram\n-   State machine diagram\n-   Object diagram\n-   Deployment diagram\n-   Timing diagram\n-   Package diagram\n-   Composite structure diagram\n-   Profile diagram\n-   Communication diagram\n[**https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/uml-diagrams-full-course/**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/uml-diagrams-full-course/)\n**Non-UML diagrams**\n-   Wireframe graphical interface\n\n<https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-a-wireframe-ux-design-tutorial-website>-   Archimate diagram\n-   Specification and Description Language (SDL)\n-   Ditaa diagram\n-   Gantt diagram\n<http://plantuml.com>\n\n<https://mermaidjs.github.io> (Can be rendered using markdown in gitlab)\n**Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)**\n\nBusiness Process Model and Notation(BPMN) is a[graphical representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_visualization)for specifying[business processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process)in a[business process model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_modeling).\nOriginally developed by the[Business Process Management Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Management_Initiative)(BPMI), BPMN has been maintained by the[Object Management Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Management_Group)(OMG) since the two organizations merged in 2005.

Accidental complexity relates to problems which engineers create and can fix; for example, the details of writing and optimizing[assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language)code or the delays caused by batch processing. Essential complexity is caused by the problem to be solved, and nothing can remove it; if users want a program to do 30 different things, then those 30 things are essential and the program must do those 30 different things.\nBrooks claims that the accidental complexity has decreased substantially, and today's programmers spend most of their time addressing essential complexity. Brooks argues that this means that shrinking all the accidental activities to zero will not give the same order-of-magnitude improvement as attempting to decrease essential complexity. While Brooks insists that there is no one[silver bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_bullet), he believes that a series of innovations attacking essential complexity could lead to significant improvements. One technology that had made significant improvement in the area of accidental complexity was the invention of[high-level programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language), such as[Ada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)).Today's languages, such as[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)),[C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B),[C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language))and[Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), are considered to be improvements, but not of the same order of magnitude.\nBrooks advocates \"growing\" software organically through incremental development. He suggests devising and implementing the main and subprograms right at the beginning, filling in the working sub-sections later. He believes that programming this way excites the engineers and provides a working system at every stage of development.\nBrooks goes on to argue that there is a difference between \"good\" designers and \"great\" designers. He postulates that as programming is a creative process, some designers are inherently better than others. He suggests that there is as much as a tenfold difference between an ordinary designer and a great one. He then advocates treating star designers equally well as star managers, providing them not just with equal[remuneration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remuneration), but also all the perks of higher status: large office, staff, travel funds, etc.\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet>\n\n## Joel Test**\n-   Do you use source control?\n-   Can you make a build in one step?\n-   Do you make daily builds?\n-   Do you have a bug database?\n-   Do you fix bugs before writing new code?\n-   Do you have an up-to-date schedule?\n-   Do you have a spec?\n-   Do programmers have quiet working conditions?\n-   Do you use the best tools money can buy?\n-   Do you have testers?\n-   Do new candidates write code during their interview?\n-   Do you do hallway usability testing?\n<https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code>\n\n<https://medium.com/squad-engineering/squad-takes-the-joel-test-9189709a6235>\n\n## The 7 R's: Common use cases and deployment**\n-   Rehost (also known as \"lift-and-shift\")\n\nQuickly moving applications to the cloud without changing them.\n-   Refactor (also known as rearchitect)\n\nChanging the way applications are architected and developed, usually by employing cloud-native features.\n-   Re-platform (sometimes referred to as \"lift-tinker-and-shift\")\n\nMaking a few optimizations to applications---but without changing their core architecture, like moving from self-managed Kubernetes to Amazon EKS.\n-   Repurchase (casually known as \"drop and shop\")\n\nReplacing your current environment by moving to a newer version of software or purchasing an entirely new solution.\n-   Relocate\n\nUsing VMware Cloud on AWS to quickly relocate up to hundreds of applications virtualized on vSphere to the AWS Cloud in days and without changing them.\n-   Retire\n\nIdentifying assets that are no longer useful and turning them off, strengthening your business case by focusing on more widely used resources.\n-   Retain\n\nLeaving the application on-premises---for now, at least.\n**When building a full-stack feature, start where the data is**\n\n**Exposing some data from the database?**\n\nStart with the backend.
