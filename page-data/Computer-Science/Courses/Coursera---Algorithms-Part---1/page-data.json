The allowed operations are:\n    -   **swap(i,j): swap the pebble in bucketiwith the pebble in bucketj.**\n    -   **color(i): determine the color of the pebble in bucketi.**\n\nThe performance requirements are as follows:\n-   At mostncalls tocolor().\n-   At mostncalls toswap().\n-   Constant extra space.\n## 3.1 Merge Sort\n\n1.  **Merging with smaller auxiliary array.**Suppose that the subarray𝚊[𝟶]to𝚊[𝚗−𝟷]is sorted and the subarray𝚊[𝚗]to𝚊[𝟸∗𝚗−𝟷]is sorted.

Quick Sort\n\n1.  **Nuts and bolts.**A disorganized carpenter has a mixed pile ofnnuts andnbolts. The goal is to find the corresponding pairs of nuts and bolts. Each nut fits exactly one bolt and each bolt fits exactly one nut. By fitting a nut and a bolt together, the carpenter can see which one is bigger (but the carpenter cannot compare two nuts or two bolts directly). Design an algorithm for the problem that usesnlogncompares (probabilistically).\n\nSolution -\n\nSuppose we choose a nut and partition all bolts in {1...n}, by comparing with this nut, into three intervals : {1...i-1}, {i}, {i+1, n} such that each bolt in {1, i-1} is smaller, bolt i matches and each bolt in {i+1, n} is larger than the chosen nut. This procedure is similar to the partition procedure used in quicksort and can be implemented in O(n). Now, we can use the matching bolt to partition all nuts in three intervals in a similar manner so that the nut i and bolt i match. We have reduced the problem of finding matchings in the interval {1...n} into two smaller subproblems: finding matchings in the intervals {1...i-1} and {i+1...n}.\n\nIf at each step, we choose the nut (to partition the bolts) randomly, we will get similar performance guarantees as quicksort i.e., randomized**O(n log n)**time.\n2.  **Selection in two sorted arrays.**Given two sorted arraysa[]andb[], of sizesn1andn2, respectively, design an algorithm to find thekthlargest key.

The two methods return a key that is chosen uniformly at random among the remaining keys, with the latter method also removing that key. The𝚜𝚊𝚖𝚙𝚕𝚎()method should take constant time; the𝚍𝚎𝚕𝚁𝚊𝚗𝚍𝚘𝚖()method should take logarithmic time. Do not worry about resizing the underlying array.\n3.  **Taxicab numbers.**A*taxicab*number is an integer that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes of positive integers in two different ways:a3+b3=c3+d3. For example,1729is the smallest taxicab number:93+103=13+123. Design an algorithm to find all taxicab numbers less thann.\n    -   **Version 1: Use time proportional ton2lognand space proportional ton2.**\n    -   **Version 2: Use time proportional ton2lognand space proportional ton.**\n## 4.2.
