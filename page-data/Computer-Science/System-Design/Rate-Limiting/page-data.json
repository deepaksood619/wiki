The primary egress queuing discipline (qdisc) on any device is known as the root qdisc. The root qdisc will contain one class. This single HTB class will be set with two parameters, a rate and a ceil. These values should be the same for the top-level class, and will represent the total available bandwidth on the link.\\nIn HTB, rate means the guaranteed bandwidth available for a given class and ceil is short for ceiling, which indicates the maximum bandwidth that class is allowed to consume. Any bandwidth used between rate and ceil is borrowed from a parent class, hence the suggestion that rate and ceil be the same in the top-level class.\\nHierarchical Token Bucket implements a classful queuing mechanism for the linux traffic control system, and provides rate and ceil to allow the user to control the absolute bandwidth to particular classes of traffic as well as indicate the ratio of distribution of bandwidth when extra bandwidth become available(up to ceil).\\n\", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket\"\n  }, \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket\")), mdx(\"h2\", {\n    \"id\": \"leaky-bucket\"\n  }, \"Leaky Bucket**\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket\"\n  }, \"Leaky bucket\"), \"(closely related to\", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"href\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket\"\n  }, \"token bucket\"), \") is an algorithm that provides a simple, intuitive approach to rate limiting via a queue which you can think of as a bucket holding the requests.

A rate limiting algorithm is used to check if the user session (or IP-address) has to be limited based on the information in the session cache.\nIn case a client made too many requests within a given timeframe,[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)-Servers can respond with status code[429: Too Many Requests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#429_Too_Many_Requests).\nHowever, the session management and rate limiting algorithm usually must be built into the application running on the web server, rather than the web server itself.\n**Datacenters**\n\nDatacenters widely use rate-limiting to control the share of resources given to different tenants and applications according to their service level agreement.A variety of rate-limiting techniques are applied in datacenters using software and hardware. Virtualized datacenters may also apply rate-limiting at the hypervisor layer. Two important performance metrics of rate-limiters in datacenters are resource footprint (memory and CPU usage) which determines scalability, and precision. There usually exists a trade-off, that is, higher precision can be achieved by dedicating more resources to the rate-limiters. A considerable body of research exists with focus on improving performance of rate-limiting in datacenters.\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_limiting>\n\n## Uses**\n-   Limit use of an API in API as a service\n-   Prevent DDOS attack\n**Why**\n-   UX\n-   Security\n-   Operational cost\n**Kinds**\n-   User based rate limiting (per api key)\n-   Concurrency (how many sessions per user)\n-   Location / IP\n-   Server\n**Algorithms for rate limiting**\n-   Token bucket\n-   Leaky bucket\n-   Fixed window counter\n-   Sliding window log\n-   Sliding window counter\n**Token Bucket**\n\nThetoken bucketis an[algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm)used in[packet switched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet-switching)[computer networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network)and[telecommunications networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication). It can be used to check that[data transmissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transmission), in the form of[packets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_packet), conform to defined limits on[bandwidth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing))and[burstiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burst_transmission)(a measure of the unevenness or variations in the[traffic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_traffic_measurement)flow). It can also be used as a[scheduling algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_algorithm)to determine the timing of transmissions that will comply with the limits set for the bandwidth and burstiness.\nThe token bucket algorithm can be conceptually understood as follows\n-   A token is added to the bucket every*1/r* seconds.\n-   The bucket can hold at the most*b*tokens. If a token arrives when the bucket is full, it is discarded.\n-   When a packet (network layer[PDU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_data_unit)) of*n*bytes arrives,\n-   If at least*n*tokens are in the bucket,*n*tokens are removed from the bucket, and the packet is sent to the network.\n-   If fewer than*n*tokens are available, no tokens are removed from the bucket, and the packet is considered to benon-conformant.\nThis solution can have problem in a distributed environment where each user can come at a different server. Can cause a race condition too.\n![/ c 1<611 (Buckcf 5 /vmin Il : OJ : OS 5 U2 ](media/Rate-Limiting-image1.png)\n**Hierarchical Token Bucket**\n\nThe hierarchical token bucket (HTB) is a faster replacement for the[class-based queueing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-based_queueing) (CBQ) [queuing discipline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queuing_discipline) in [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux). It is useful to limit a client's[download](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Download)/[upload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upload)rate so that the limited client cannot saturate the total bandwidth.\nConceptually, HTB is an arbitrary number of token buckets arranged in a hierarchy. The primary egress queuing discipline (qdisc) on any device is known as the root qdisc. The root qdisc will contain one class. This single HTB class will be set with two parameters, a rate and a ceil. These values should be the same for the top-level class, and will represent the total available bandwidth on the link.\nIn HTB, rate means the guaranteed bandwidth available for a given class and ceil is short for ceiling, which indicates the maximum bandwidth that class is allowed to consume. Any bandwidth used between rate and ceil is borrowed from a parent class, hence the suggestion that rate and ceil be the same in the top-level class.\nHierarchical Token Bucket implements a classful queuing mechanism for the linux traffic control system, and provides rate and ceil to allow the user to control the absolute bandwidth to particular classes of traffic as well as indicate the ratio of distribution of bandwidth when extra bandwidth become available(up to ceil).\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket>\n\n## Leaky Bucket**\n\n[Leaky bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket)(closely related to[token bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket)) is an algorithm that provides a simple, intuitive approach to rate limiting via a queue which you can think of as a bucket holding the requests. When a request is registered, it is appended to the end of the queue. At a regular interval, the first item on the queue is processed. This is also known as a first in first out (FIFO) queue. If the queue is full, then additional requests are discarded (or leaked).\n![Capacity Two requests processed per minute Request 3: Dropped Request 2: Queued Request 1: Queued ](media/Rate-Limiting-image2.png)\nThe advantage of this algorithm is that it smooths out bursts of requests and processes them at an approximately average rate. It's also easy to implement on a single server or load balancer, and is memory efficient for each user given the limited queue size.\nHowever, a burst of traffic can fill up the queue with old requests and starve more recent requests from being processed. It also provides no guarantee that requests get processed in a fixed amount of time. Additionally, if you load balance servers for fault tolerance or increased throughput, you must use a policy to coordinate and enforce the limit between them.\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket>\n\n## Fixed Window**\n\nIn afixed windowalgorithm, a window size of n seconds (typically using human-friendly values, such as 60 or 3600 seconds) is used to track the rate. Each incoming request increments the counter for the window. If the counter exceeds a threshold, the request is discarded. The windows are typically defined by the floor of the current timestamp, so 12:00:03 with a 60 second window length, would be in the 12:00:00 window.\n![12:00 Request 3: Denied Request 2: Ok Request 1: Ok 12:01 ](media/Rate-Limiting-image3.png)\nThe advantage of this algorithm is that it ensures more recent requests gets processed without being starved by old requests. However, a single burst of traffic that occurs near the boundary of a window can result in twice the rate of requests being processed, because it will allow requests for both the current and next windows within a short time. Additionally, if many consumers wait for a reset window, for example at the top of the hour, then they may stampede your API at the same time.\n**Sliding Log**\n\nSliding Lograte limiting involves tracking a time stamped log for each consumer's request. These logs are usually stored in a hash set or table that is sorted by time. Logs with timestamps beyond a threshold are discarded. When a new request comes in, we calculate the sum of logs to determine the request rate. If the request would exceed the threshold rate, then it is held.\n![Request at 12:00:35 Holc Request at 12:00:15 0k Request at 12:00:01 0k ](media/Rate-Limiting-image4.png)\nThe advantage of this algorithm is that it does not suffer from the boundary conditions of fixed windows. The rate limit will be enforced precisely. Also, because the sliding log is tracked for each consumer, you don't have the stampede effect that challenges fixed windows. However, it can be very expensive to store an unlimited number of logs for every request. It's also expensive to compute because each request requires calculating a summation over the consumer's prior requests, potentially across a cluster of servers. As a result, it does not scale well to handle large bursts of traffic or denial of service attacks.\n**Sliding Window Counter**\n\nThis is a hybrid approach that combines the low processing cost of the fixed window algorithm, and the improved boundary conditions of the sliding log. Like the fixed window algorithm, we track a counter for each fixed window. Next, we account for a weighted value of the previous window's request rate based on the current timestamp to smooth out bursts of traffic. For example, if the current window is 25% through, then we weight the previous window's count by 75%. The relatively small number of data points needed to track per key allows us to scale and distribute across large clusters.\n![Request 3: Ok Request 2: Denied Request 1: Ok ](media/Rate-Limiting-image5.png)\nWe recommend thesliding windowapproach because it gives the flexibility to scale rate limiting with good performance. The rate windows are an intuitive way she to present rate limit data to API consumers. It also avoids the starvation problem of leaky bucket, and the bursting problems of fixed window implementations.\n𝗟𝗢𝗦𝗦𝗬 𝗖𝗢𝗨𝗡𝗧\n\nIt is used to identify elements in a data stream whose frequency count
