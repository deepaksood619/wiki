Ambassador essentially serves as an Envoy ingress controller, but with many more features.\nKey features include:\n-   Self-service configuration, via Kubernetes annotations\n-   First class[gRPC and HTTP/2 support](https://www.getambassador.io/user-guide/grpc)\n-   Support for CORS, timeouts, weighted round robin ([canary](https://www.getambassador.io/reference/canary)),[rate limiting](https://www.getambassador.io/reference/services/rate-limit-service)\n-   [Istio integration](https://www.getambassador.io/user-guide/with-istio)\n-   [Authentication](https://www.getambassador.io/reference/services/auth-service)\n-   Robust TLS support, including TLS client-certificate authentication\n<https://github.com/datawire/ambassador>\n![Primary use case Learning curve Cost Configurability Config language Config style for endpoints GUI and Drag & Drop Config Authentication support Govemance model Installation and ops Kubernetes Cloud laaS Private Data Center Scalability Primary scaling approach Additional data store required for horizontal scaling Ambassador Microservices gateway Simple Open source YAML (Kubernetes annotations) Declarative No Yes Decentralised, self-service Easy (Official YAML bootstrap available) Horizontal No, state managed via Kubernetes Traefik Microservices gateway Simple Open source TOML Declarative No Only basic auth out-of-the-box Decentralised, self-service Easy (Official YAML bootstrap available) Easy Easy Horizontal Yes, KN store required e.g. Consul, etcd, ZK, boltdb OpenResty Monolith / microservices gateway Moderate Open source Text files (nginx.conf etc) Declarative No Yes Decentralised Moderate (Unofficial / unmaintained Yaml bootstrap available Moderate Moderate Horizontal Yes, KN store required e.g. redis Cloud Vendor Impl Expose backend services, including microservices and FaaS Moderate Typically YAML or JSON Declarative / imperative Not typically Yes (Although may offer limited customisation) Decentralised (typically) Easy-moderate Easy Horizontal Yes.
