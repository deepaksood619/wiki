In a bulkhead architecture, elements of an application are isolated into pools so that if one fails, the others will continue to function. It's named after the sectioned partitions (bulkheads) of a ship's hull. If the hull of a ship is compromised, only the damaged section fills with water, which prevents the ship from sinking.\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2FT5edyKOg>-   [Cache-Aside](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/cache-aside)\n-   [Choreography](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/choreography)\n-   [Circuit Breaker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/circuit-breaker)\n-   [Claim Check](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/claim-check)\n-   [Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/cqrs)\n-   [Compensating Transaction](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/compensating-transaction)\n-   [Competing Consumers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/competing-consumers)\n-   [Compute Resource Consolidation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/compute-resource-consolidation)\n-   [Data management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/category/data-management)\n-   [Design and implementation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/category/design-implementation)\n-   [Event Sourcing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing)\n-   [External Configuration Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/external-configuration-store)\n-   [Federated Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/federated-identity)\n-   [Gatekeeper](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/gatekeeper)\n-   [Gateway Aggregation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/gateway-aggregation)\n-   [Gateway Offloading](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/gateway-offloading)\n-   [Gateway Routing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/gateway-routing)\n-   [Health Endpoint Monitoring](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/health-endpoint-monitoring)\n-   [Index Table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/index-table)\n-   [Leader Election](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/leader-election)\n-   [Management and monitoring](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/category/management-monitoring)\n-   [Materialized View](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/materialized-view)\n-   [Messaging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/category/messaging)\n-   [Performance and scalability](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/category/performance-scalability)\n-   [Pipes and Filters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/pipes-and-filters)\n-   [Priority Queue](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/priority-queue)\n-   [Publisher/Subscriber](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/publisher-subscriber)\n-   [Queue-Based Load Leveling](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/queue-based-load-leveling)\n-   [Resiliency](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/category/resiliency)\n-   [Retry](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/retry)\n-   [Scheduler Agent Supervisor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/scheduler-agent-supervisor)\n-   [Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/category/security)\n-   [Sharding](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/sharding)\n-   [Sidecar](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/sidecar)\n-   [Static Content Hosting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/static-content-hosting)\n-   [Strangler](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/strangler)\n-   [Throttling](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/throttling)\n-   [Valet Key](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/valet-key)\n3.
