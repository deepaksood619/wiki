It is a logical entity.\nA class defines the behavior of an object and the kind of information an object can store. The information in a class is stored in attributes, and functions that belong to a class are called methods. A child class inherits the attributes and methods from its parent class.\nClasses are the foundation of object-oriented programming. Classes represent real-world things you want to model in your programs: for example dogs, cars, and robots. You can use a class to make objects, which are specific instances of dogs, cars and robots. A class defines the general behavior that a whole category of objects can have, and the information that can be associated with those objects.\n\nClasses can inherit from each other - you can write a class that extends the functionality of an existing class. This allows you to code efficiently for a wide variety of situations.\nClasses provide a means of bundling data and functionality together.\n\nCreating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made.\n**Abstraction**\n\nHiding internal details and showing functionalityis known as abstraction. For example: phone call, we don't know the internal processing.\nIn java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.\n**Leaky Abstraction**\n\n<https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions>\n\nAbstractions fail. Sometimes a little, sometimes a lot. There's leakage. Things go wrong. It happens all over the place when you have abstractions.\nAll non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky.\nTCP attempts to provide a complete abstraction of an underlying unreliable network, but sometimes, the network leaks through the abstraction and you feel the things that the abstraction can't quite protect you from. This is but one example of what I've dubbed the Law of Leaky Abstractions:\n**Encapsulation**\n\nEncapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates.Other way to think about encapsulation is, it is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.\nEncapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore, it is also known asdata hiding.\n**Inheritance**\n\nWhen one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent objecti.e. known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.\n-   Single Inheritance\n-   Multilevel Inheritance\n-   Hierarchical Inheritance\n-   Hybrid Inheritance\nInterface Inheritance (aka subtyping)\n\nImplementation Inheritance (aka inheritance)\n**Polymorphism**\n\nWhen**one task is performed by different ways**i.e. known as polymorphism. For example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something e.g. shape or rectangle etc.\n\nIn java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.\n\nAnother example can be to speak something e.g. cat speaks meaw, dog barks woof etc.\nTypes of polymorphism\n\n1.  Parametric polymorphism\n\nThis is a pretty common technique in many languages, albeit better known as \"Generics\". The core idea is to allow programmers to use a wildcard type when defining data structures that can later be filled with any type.\n\n![class List< > { class Node< T > { T data Node< T > next public Node< T > head public void pushFront(T data The T is the type variable because you can later \"assign\" any type you want: List< String myNumberList List< String >(); new myNumberList . pushFront ( \" foo \" myNumberList . pushFront(8) // Error: 8 is not a string ](media/OOPS---SOLID-image1.png)\n2.  Subtype polymorphism (most used type, using shape like triangle, rectangle and calling area like traingle.area(), rectangle.area())\n\nSubtyping is better known as object oriented inheritance. The classic example is a vehicle type, here in Java:\n\nabstract class Vehicle {\nabstract double getWeight();\n}\n\nclass Car extends Vehicle {\ndouble getWeight() { return 10.0; }\n}\n\nclass Truck extends Vehicle {\ndouble getWeight() { return 100.0; }\n}\n\nclass Toyota extends Car { /* ... */ }\n\nstatic void printWeight(Vehicle v) {\n// Allowed because all vehicles have to have this method\nSystem.out.println(v.getWeight());\n}\n3.  Ad-Hoc polymorphism (AKA Type Classes)\n\nThis is more commonly known as function or operator overloading. In languages that allow this, you can define a function multiple times to deal with different input types. For example in Java:\n\nclass Printer {\npublic String prettyPrint(int x) { /* ... */ }\npublic String prettyPrint(char c) { /* ... */ }\n}\n4.  Row Polymorphism\n\n5.  Kind Polymorphism\n\n6.  Higher-rank Polymorphism\n\n7.  Linearity Polymorphism\n\n8.  Levity Polymorphism\n<https://dev.to/jvanbruegge/what-the-heck-is-polymorphism-nmh>\n\n## Inheritance, Encapsulation and Polymorphism are 3 pillars of OOPs**\n**Problems**\n\n**Inheritance**\n-   Banana Monkey Jungle Problem\n\nThe problem with object-oriented languages is they've got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle.\nSolution\n-   Contain\n-   Delegate-   Diamond Problem\n\n![PoweredDevice Scanner ](media/OOPS---SOLID-image2.png)\n\nBoth Scanner and Printer has the same function, so Copier will inherit which function? (Most OO language doesn't let you do that)-   Fragile Base Class Problem\n\nIf a parent class is changed, than child class can stop working-   The Hierarchy Problem (Categorical Hierarchies)\n\nEvery time I start at a new company, I struggle with the problem when I'm creating a place to put my Company Documents, e.g. the Employee Handbook. Do I create a folder called Documents and then create a folder called Company in that. Or do I create a folder called Company and then create a folder called Documents in that?\n\nUsing tags we can solve this problem. A company document can be labelled as document and also company. So it's both. **Tags have no order or hierarchy.**\nDon't use categorical hierarchies (Use containment hierarchies insted)\n**Encapsulation**\n-   The Reference Problem\n\nObject's reference is passed to functions and changing something to object can change the original object.\nSolution - Deep Copy (But system objects cannot be copied)\n**Others**\n-   **Mixin**\n\nIn[object-oriented programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming_language), a**Mixin**is a[class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_science))that contains methods for use by other classes without having to be the parent class of those other classes. How those other classes gain access to the mixin's methods depends on the language. Mixins are sometimes described as being \"included\" rather than \"inherited\".\nMixins encourage[code reuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_reuse)and can be used to avoid the inheritance ambiguity that multiple inheritance can cause(the \"[diamond problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance#The_diamond_problem)\"), or to work around lack of support for multiple inheritance in a language. A mixin can also be viewed as an[interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(object-oriented_programming))with implemented[methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_science)). This pattern is an example of enforcing the[dependency inversion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle).\nMixins are a language concept that allows a programmer to inject some code into a[class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)). Mixin programming is a style of[software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development), in which units of functionality are created in a class and then mixed in with other classes.\nA mixin class acts as the parent class, containing the desired functionality. A[subclass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subclass_(computer_science))can then inherit or simply reuse this functionality, but not as a means of specialization. Typically, the mixin will export the desired functionality to a[child class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subclass_(computer_science)), without creating a rigid, single \"is a\" relationship. Here lies the important difference between the concepts of mixins and[inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)), in that the child class can still inherit all the features of the parent class, but, the semantics about the child \"being a kind of\" the parent need not be necessarily applied.\n**Advantages**\n\n1.  It provides a mechanism for[multiple inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance)by allowing multiple classes to use the common functionality, but without the complex semantics of multiple inheritance.2.  [Code reusability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_reuse): Mixins are useful when a programmer wants to share functionality between different classes. Instead of repeating the same code over and over again, the common functionality can simply be grouped into a mixin and then included into each class that requires it.3.  Mixins allow inheritance and use of only the desired features from the parent class, not necessarily all of the features from the parent class.-   **Delegation**\n\nDelegation means that an object shall perform only what it knows best, and leave the rest to other objects.\nDelegation can be implemented with two different mechanisms: composition and inheritance. Sadly, very often only inheritance is listed among the pillars of OOP techniques, forgetting that it is an implementation of the more generic and fundamental mechanism of delegation; perhaps a better nomenclature for the two techniques could beexplicit delegation(composition) andimplicit delegation (inheritance).-   **Inheritance**\n    -   Python does not implicitly call the parent implementation when you override a method.\n    -   overriding is a way to block implicit delegation.-   **Composition**\n    -   Composition means that an object knows another object, and explicitly delegates some tasks to it.\n    -   Composition provides a superior way to manage delegation since it can selectively delegate the access, even mask some attributes or methods, while inheritance cannot.\n    -   In Python you also avoid the memory problems that might arise when you put many objects inside another; Python handles everything through its reference, i.e. through a pointer to the memory position of the thing, so the size of an attribute is constant and very limited.-   **Composition over Inheritance**\n\nComposition over inheritance(orcomposite reuse principle) in[object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)(OOP) is the principle that classes should achieve [polymorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science))behavior and[code reuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_reuse)by their[composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition)(by containing instances of other classes that implement the desired functionality) rather than[inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(computer_science))from a base or parent class.This is an often-stated principle of OOP, such as in the influential book[Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns).\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance>-   **Monkey Patching**\n    -   A MonkeyPatch is a piece of Python code which extends or modifies other code at runtime (typically at startup).\n    -   For instance, consider a class that has a methodget_data.

Iteration by iteration, the outputs of OOAD activities, analysis models for OOA and design models for OOD respectively, will be refined and evolve continuously driven by key factors like risks and business value.\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_analysis_and_design>\n\n## Important Points**\n-   class, object (and the difference between the two)\n-   method (as opposed to, say, a C function)\n-   virtual method, pure virtual method\n-   class/static method\n-   static/class initializer\n-   constructor\n-   destructor/finalizer\n-   superclass or base class\n-   subclass or derived class\n<https://medium.com/@cscalfani/goodbye-object-oriented-programming-a59cda4c0e53>\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin>\n\n<http://blog.thedigitalcatonline.com/blog/2014/08/20/python-3-oop-part-3-delegation-composition-and-inheritance>\n\n## SOLID principles**\n\n1.  **Single Responsibility Principle**\n\nA class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job\n2.  **Open Closed Principle**\n\nObjects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification\n3.  **Liskov Substitution Principle**\n\nObjects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program\nLetq(x)be a property provable about objects ofxof typeT. Thenq(y)should be provable for objectsyof typeSwhereSis a subtype ofT.\nAll this is stating is that every subclass/derived class should be substitutable for their base/parent class.\n4.  **Interface Segregation Principle**\n\nMany client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface\nA client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.\n5.  **Dependency Inversion principle**\n\nEntities must depend on abstractions not on concretions\nIt states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.\nThe dependency inversion principle tells us that we should always try to have dependencies on interfaces (or Abstract Classes), not classes.\n<https://javapapers.com/oops/association-aggregation-composition-abstraction-generalization-realization-dependency>\n\n<https://scotch.io/bar-talk/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design>\n\n##
