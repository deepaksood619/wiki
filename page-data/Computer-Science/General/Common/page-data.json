Such implementations cannot encode times after 03:14:07 UTC on 19 January 2038. Similar to the[Y2K problem](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Year_2000_problem), the Year 2038 problem is caused by insufficient capacity used to represent time.\n**RFC**\n\n**4122** - UUID/GUID <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122.html>\n\n## Epoch Time / Unix Time**\n\nUnix time(also known asEpoch time,POSIX time,seconds since the Epoch,orUNIX Epoch time) is a system for describing a[point in time](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Timestamp). It is the number of[seconds](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Second)that have elapsed since theUnix epoch, minus[leap seconds](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Leap_second); the Unix epoch is 00:00:00[UTC](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Coordinated_Universal_Time)on 1 January 1970 (an arbitrary date); leap seconds are ignored, with a leap second having the same Unix time as the second before it, and every day is treated as if it contains exactly86400seconds.Due to this treatment Unix time is not a true representation of UTC.\nIt should also be pointed out that this point in time technically does not change no matter where you are located on the globe. This is very useful to computer systems for tracking and sorting dated information in dynamic and distributed applications both online and client side. The reason why Unix timestamps are used by many webmasters is because they can represent all time zones at once.\n<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Unix_time>\n\n<https://www.epochconverter.com>\n\n<https://everytimezone.com>\n\n## Time - ISO 8601**\n\nISO 8601Data elements and interchange formats -- Information interchange -- Representation of dates and times is an[international standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_standard)covering the exchange of[date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_date)- and[time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time)-related data. It was issued by the [International Organization for Standardization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization) (ISO) and was first published in 1988. The purpose of this standard is to provide an unambiguous and well-defined method of representing dates and times, so as to avoid misinterpretation of numeric representations of dates and times, particularly when data is transferred between [countries with different conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_and_time_notation_by_country) for writing numeric dates and times.\n**General Principles**\n-   Date and time values are ordered from the largest to smallest unit of time: year, month (or week), day, hour, minute, second, and fraction of second. The[lexicographical order](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lexicographical_order)of the representation thus corresponds to chronological order, except for date representations involving negative years or time offset. This allows dates to be naturally[sorted](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sorting)by, for example, file systems.\n-   Each date and time value has a fixed number of digits that must be padded with[leading zeros](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Leading_zero).\n-   Representations can be done in one of two formats-- a basic format with a minimal number of separators or an extended format with separators added to enhance human readability.The standard notes that \"The basic format should be avoided in[plain text](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Plain_text).\"The separator used between date values (year, month, week, and day) is the[hyphen](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hyphen), while the[colon](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Colon_(punctuation))is used as the separator between time values (hours, minutes, and seconds). For example, the 6th day of the 1st month of the year 2009 may be written as\"2009-01-06\"in the extended format or simply as \"20090106\" in the basic format without ambiguity.\n-   For reduced precision,any number of values may be dropped from any of the date and time representations, but in the order from the least to the most significant. For example, \"2004-05\" is a valid ISO 8601 date, which indicates May (the fifth month) 2004. This format will never represent the 5th day of an unspecified month in 2004, nor will it represent a time-span extending from 2004 into 2005.\n-   If necessary for a particular application, the standard supports the addition of a[decimal fraction](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Decimal_fractions)to the smallest time value in the representation.\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601>\n\n## IEC Prefixes**\n\n| **Factor** | **Name** | **Symbol** | **Origin**              | **Derivation**  |\n|------------|------------|-------------|----------------------|---------------|\n| 2^10^      | kibi      | Ki          | kilobinary: (2^10^)^1^  | kilo: (10^3^)^1^ |\n| 2^20^      | mebi      | Mi          | megabinary: (2^10^)^2^ | mega: (10^3^)^2^ |\n| 2^30^      | gibi      | Gi          | gigabinary: (2^10^)^3^  | giga: (10^3^)^3^ |\n| 2^40^      | tebi      | Ti          | terabinary: (2^10^)^4^  | tera: (10^3^)^4^ |\n| 2^50^      | pebi      | Pi          | petabinary: (2^10^)^5^  | peta: (10^3^)^5^ |\n| 2^60^      | exbi      | Ei          | exabinary: (2^10^)^6^   | exa: (10^3^)^6^  |\n<https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html>\n\n## shim** in computing means application compatibility workaround.\n**IMP Coding Snippets**\n\n**Sweep Line Algorithm (Find intersection of two lines)**\n\nUsing 1d range search\n**Parameterization**\n\n<https://www.toptal.com/python/python-parameterized-design-patterns>\nThis is a solution to python challenge level 7.\n\nThis is the first code that i wrote that involves Image Processing and i came to it by myself.\nProblem - <http://www.pythonchallenge.com/pc/def/oxygen.html>\n\nSolution - python 7.py\n<https://slate.com/technology/2019/10/consequential-computer-code-software-history.html>\n\n<https://medium.com/the-atlantic/the-coming-software-apocalypse-4ffb43f3b288>ƒ\n<https://github.com/RockstarLang/rockstar>\n\n[The Art of Code - Dylan Beattie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6avJHaC3C2U)\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vPt7GI-2kc>\n<https://blog.codinghorror.com/new-programming-jargon>\n\n## Typosquatting**\n\n<https://medium.com/@williambengtson/python-typosquatting-for-fun-not-profit-99869579c35d>\n\n## Three-way comparison Operator (SpaceShip Operator < = >)**\n\nIn[computer science](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Computer_science), athree-way comparisontakes two values A and B belonging to a type with a[total order](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Total_order)and determines whether A < B, A = B, or A > B in a single operation, in accordance with the mathematical[law of trichotomy](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Trichotomy_(mathematics)).\n<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Three-way_comparison>\n\n## FP64, FP32, FP16, BFloat16, TF32 (Floating Points)**\n\n<https://medium.com/@moocaholic/fp64-fp32-fp16-bfloat16-tf32-and-other-members-of-the-zoo-a1ca7897d407>\n\n## Valid Emails**\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60BPETbra9U>\n\n## [Zawinski's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Zawinski#Principles)---** \"Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail.
