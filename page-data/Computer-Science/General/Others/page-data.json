The termglobally unique identifier(GUID) is also used, typically in software created by Microsoft.\nWhen generated according to the standard methods, UUIDs are for practical purposes unique, without depending for their uniqueness on a central registration authority or coordination between the parties generating them, unlike most other[numbering schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbering_scheme). While the probability that a UUID will be duplicated is not zero, it is close enough to zero to be negligible.\nThus, anyone can create a UUID and use it to identify something with near certainty that the identifier does not duplicate one that has already been, or will be, created to identify something else. Information labeled with UUIDs by independent parties can therefore be later combined into a single database or transmitted on the same channel, with a negligible probability of duplication.\n**Format**\n\nIn its canonical textual representation, the 16[octets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octet_(computing))of a UUID are represented as 32[hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal)(base-16) digits, displayed in 5 groups separated by hyphens, in the form 8-4-4-4-12 for a total of 36 characters (32 alphanumeric characters and 4 hyphens). For example:\n\n123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000\n\nxxxxxxxx-xxxx-Mxxx-Nxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nThe 4 bits of digitMindicate the UUID version, and the 1--3 most significant bits of digitNindicate the UUID variant. In the example,*M*is1, and*N*isa(10xx~2~), meaning that the UUID is a variant-1, version-1 UUID; that is, a time-based DCE/RFC 4122 UUID.\n\nThe canonical 8-4-4-4-12 format string is based on the \"record layout\" for the 16 bytes of the UUID:\n\n| **Name**                           | **Length (bytes)** | **Length (hex digits)** | **Contents**                                                                                 |\n|-------------------|-----------|------------|------------------------------|\n| time_low                           | 4                  | 8                       | integer giving the low 32 bits of the time                                                   |\n| time_mid                           | 2                  | 4                       | integer giving the middle 16 bits of the time                                                |\n| time_hi_and_version                | 2                  | 4                       | 4-bit \"version\" in the most significant bits, followed by the high 12 bits of the time     |\n| clock_seq_hi_and_res clock_seq_low | 2                  | 4                       | 1--3-bit \"variant\" in the most significant bits, followed by the 13--15-bit clock sequence |\n| node                               | 6                  | 12                      | the 48-bit node id                                                                           |\n![Timestamp (48) Address Family (8) 573E010013647A49B8F6B3E35E8B3C4 Reserved (16) Host ID (56) ](media/Others-image1.png)\n\n<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122.html>\n\n## UUID V1 : Uniqueness**\n\nUUID v1 is generated by using a combination the host computers MAC address and the current date and time. In addition to this, it also introduces another random component just to be sure of its uniqueness.\nThis means you are guaranteed to get a completely unique ID, unless you generate it from thesamecomputer, and at the exactsametime. In that case, the chance of collision changes from impossible to very very small because of the random bits.\nThis guaranteed uniqueness comes at the cost of anonymity. Because UUID v1 takes the time and your MAC address into consideration, this also means that someone could potentially identify the time and place(i.e. computer) of creation.\n**UUID V4 : Randomness**\n\nThe generation of a v4 UUID is much simpler to comprehend. The bits that comprise a UUID v4 are generated randomly and with no inherent logic. Because of this, there is no way to identify information about the source by looking at the UUID.\nHowever, there is now a chance that a UUID could be duplicated. The question is, do you need to worry about it?\nThe short answer is no. With the sheer number of possible combinations (2^128), it would be almost impossible to generate a duplicate unless you are generating trillions of IDs every second, for many years.\nIf your application is mission critical (for example, bank transactions or medical systems), you should still add a uniqueness constraint to avoid UUIDv4 collision\n**UUID V5: Non-Random UUIDs**\n\nIf you want a unique ID that's not random, UUID v5 could be the right choice.\nUnlike v1 or v4, UUID v5 is generated by providing two pieces of input information:\n\ni.  Input string:Any string that can change in your application.\n\nii. Namespace:A fixed UUID used in combination with the input string to differentiate between UUIDs generated in different applications, and to prevent[rainbow table hacks](https://www.hackingloops.com/what-are-rainbow-tables/)\nThese two pieces of information are converted to a UUID using the SHA1 hashing algorithm.\nAn important point to note is UUID v5 isconsistent. This means that any given combination of input and namespace will result in the same UUID, every time.\nThis is great if you want to, for example, maintain a mapping of your users to their UUIDs without explicitly persisting that information to storage.\nHowever, remember that these IDs arenot random, and their uniqueness is now your responsibility.\n**Which Version Should You Use?**\n\nIf you don't know what to go with, go with v4. It's good enough, and the chances of collision are practically none.\nIf you actuallywantyour UUID to give some indication of the date and computer in which it was created, then UUID v1 may be for you (although it is).\nUUID v5 is normally used only for very specific use cases, when you want to derive a UUID from another piece of information on the fly.\n<https://www.sohamkamani.com/uuid-versions-explained>\n\n## FlakeIDs**\n\nMany distributed systems have a requirement to generate time sorted, unique ids of some kind - for distinguishing incoming events, for resolving conflicts, for using as keys in key/value stores, for logging, and a whole bunch more.\nThe basic idea behind flake ids is simple: instead of incrementing a counter each time you need an ID, use some of the top bits in an id to represent time, and then some others to represent a \"node id\", such that id generation across nodes is unique. The wonderful thing about the node id is that you can just coordinateonce- very often just by writing to config files inside your orchestration tool (chef/puppet/ansible/etc).\n**Indirection**\n\nIn[computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming),**indirection**(also called**dereferencing**) is the ability to reference something using a name, reference, or container instead of the value itself. The most common form of indirection is the act of manipulating a value through its[memory address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_address). For example, accessing a[variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(programming))through the use of a[pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)). A stored pointer that exists to provide a reference to an object by double indirection is called an*indirection node*. In some older computer architectures, indirect words supported a variety of more-or-less complicated[addressing modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addressing_mode).\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirection>\n\n## Frequency Cap**\n\nIt is a counter for unique users on a website based on session data (like cookies). There might be millions or tens of millions of users visiting a website. Frequency capping means you only show each user your ad once per day.\nRedis has a[HyperLogLog data type](https://redis.io/commands/pfcount)that is perfect for a frequency cap. It approximates set membership with a very small error rate, in exchange for O(1) time and a very small memory footprint.PFADDadds an element to a HyperLogLog set. It returns 1 if your element is not in the set already, and 0 if it is in the set.\n**Variadic**\n\nIn[mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics)and in[computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming), a**variadic function**is a[function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(programming))of indefinite[arity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity), i.e., one which accepts a variable number of[arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_(computer_science)). Support for variadic functions differs widely among[programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language).\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variadic_function>\n\n## Internationalization (\"i18n\")**\n\nInternationalization (\"i18n\") is the process of adapting app code to other languages. For example, an app might need to display data in a different format, prices, or numbers with the correct decimal or thousands separators, or even handling whether text is written right-to-left or left-to-right.

This includes translating most of the app's resources, like texts, images, and sounds.

They perceive animations as smooth so long as 60 new frames are rendered every second. That's 16ms per frame, including the time it takes for the browser to paint the new frame to the screen, leaving an app about 1 Oms to produce a frame. Respond to user actions within this time window and users feel like the result is immediate. Any longer, and the connection between action and reaction is broken. Users experience a slight perceptible delay. Within this window, things feel part of a natural and continuous progression of tasks. For most users on the web, loading pages or changing views represents a task. Beyond 1000 milliseconds (1 second), users lose focus on the task they are performing. Beyond 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds), users are frustrated and are likely to abandon tasks. They may or may not come back later. ](media/Others-image2.jpeg)\n\nRAIL Model - <https://web.dev/rail>\n\n## Linear-feedback shift register (LSFR)**\n\nIn[computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing), alinear-feedback shift register(LFSR) is a[shift register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_register)whose input bit is a[linear function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear#Boolean_functions)of its previous state.\nThe most commonly used linear function of single bits is[exclusive-or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive-or)(XOR). Thus, an LFSR is most often a shift register whose input bit is driven by the XOR of some bits of the overall shift register value.\n\nThe initial value of the LFSR is called the seed, and because the operation of the register is deterministic, the stream of values produced by the register is completely determined by its current (or previous) state. Likewise, because the register has a finite number of possible states, it must eventually enter a repeating cycle. However, an LFSR with a[well-chosen feedback function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_polynomial_(field_theory))can produce a sequence of bits that appears random and has a[very long cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_length_sequence).\nApplications of LFSRs include generating[pseudo-random numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness),[pseudo-noise sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_noise), fast digital counters, and[whitening sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitening_sequences). Both hardware and software implementations of LFSRs are common.\nThe mathematics of a[cyclic redundancy check](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check), used to provide a quick check against transmission errors, are closely related to those of an LFSR.In general, the arithmetics behind LFSRs makes them very elegant as an object to study and implement. One can produce relatively complex logics with simple building blocks. However, other methods, that are less elegant but perform better, should be considered as well.\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register>","excerpt":"Others Created: 2019-01-14
