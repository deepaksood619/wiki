Allows to specify a set query-per-second load and record latency histograms and other useful stats.\nFortio runs at a specified query per second (qps) and records an histogram of execution time and calculates percentiles (e.g. p99 ie the response time such as 99% of the requests take less than that number (in seconds, SI unit)). It can run for a set duration, for a fixed number of calls, or until interrupted (at a constant target QPS, or max speed/load per connection/thread).\n\n**Datasets for load testing databases**\n-   TPCC benchmark\n-   Yahoo!

It is intended for load-testing websites (or other systems) and figuring out how many concurrent users a system can handle.\nLocust is a scalable load testing framework written in Python\nLocust is completely event-based, and therefore it's possible to support thousands of concurrent users on a single machine. In contrast to many other event-based apps it doesn't use callbacks. Instead it uses light-weight processes, through[gevent](http://www.gevent.org/). Each locust swarming your site is actually running inside its own process (or greenlet, to be correct). This allows you to write very expressive scenarios in Python without complicating your code with callbacks.\n\n**Running Locust Distributed**\nYou start one instance of Locust in master mode using the--masterflag. This is the instance that will be running Locust's web interface where you start the test and see live statistics. The master node doesn't simulate any users itself. Instead you have to start one or ---most likely---multiple slave Locust nodes using the--slaveflag, together with the--master-host(to specify the IP/hostname of the master node).\n\n**Commands**\n```\nlocust -f tasks.py --host localhost:5000\nlocust --no-reset-stats -f mqttClient.py\n\nlocust -f mqttClient.py\n\nlocust -f mqttClient.py --master\nlocust -f mqttClient.py
