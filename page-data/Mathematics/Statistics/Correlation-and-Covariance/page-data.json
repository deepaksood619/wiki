It is easy for us to interpret the result\nIn terms of the strength of relationship, the value of the **correlation coefficient** varies between +1 and -1. A value of ± 1 indicates a perfect degree of association between the two variables. As the correlation coefficient value goes towards 0, the relationship between the two variables will be weaker. The direction of the relationship is indicated by the sign of the coefficient; a + sign indicates a positive relationship and a -- sign indicates a negative relationship.\nUsually, in statistics, we measure four types of correlations:\n-   [Pearson correlation](http://www.statisticssolutions.com/academic-solutions/membership-resources/member-profile/conducting-analyses-results/videos/pearson-correlation/)\n-   Kendall rank correlation\n-   Spearman correlation\n-   Point-Biserial correlation\n**General Correlation**\n\n1.  1, Positive Correlation - Both variables change in the same direction\n\n2.  0, Neutral Correlation - No relationship in the change of the variables, independent\n\n3.  -1, Negative Correlation - Variables change in opposite directions\n![Sxy Sample correlation formula: r = sxsy oxy Population correlation formula: p = In Excel, correlation is calculated by: =CORRELO ](media/Correlation-and-Covariance-image1.jpg)\nThe performance of some algorithms can deteriorate if two or more variables are tightly related, called **multicollinearity**. An example is linear regression, where one of the offending correlated variables should be removed in order to improve the skill of the model. We can quantify the relationship between samples of two variables using a statistical method called Pearson's correlation coefficient, named for the developer of the method, Karl Pearson.\n**Pearson r Correlation**\n\nPearsonrcorrelation is the most widely used correlation statistic to measure the degree of the relationship between linearly related variables. For example, in the stock market, if we want to measure how two stocks are related to each other, Pearsonrcorrelation is used to measure the degree of relationship between the two. The point-biserial correlation is conducted with the Pearson correlation formula except that one of the variables is dichotomous. The following formula is used to calculate the Pearsonrcorrelation:\n![](media/Correlation-and-Covariance-image2.jpg)\nr= Pearson r correlation coefficient\n\nN = number of observations\n\n∑xy = sum of the products of paired scores\n\n∑x = sum of x scores\n\n∑y = sum of y scores\n\n∑x2= sum of squared x scores\n\n∑y2= sum of squared y scores\n**Types of research questions a Pearson correlation can examine**\n-   Is there a statistically significant relationship between age, as measured in years, and height, measured in inches?\n-   Is there a relationship between temperature, measured in degrees Fahrenheit, and ice cream sales, measured by income?\n-   Is there a relationship between job satisfaction, as measured by the JSS, and income, measured in dollars?\n**Assumptions**\n\nFor the Pearsonrcorrelation, both variables should be normally distributed (normally distributed variables have a bell-shaped curve). Other assumptions include linearity and homoscedasticity. Linearity assumes a straight line relationship between each of the two variables and homoscedasticity assumes that data is equally distributed about the regression line.\n**Key Terms**\n\n**Effect size:**Cohen's standard may be used to evaluate the correlation coefficient to determine the strength of the relationship, or the effect size. Correlation coefficients between .10 and .29 represent a small association, coefficients between .30 and .49 represent a medium association, and coefficients of .50 and above represent a large association or relationship.\n**Continuous data:**Data that is interval or ratio level. This type of data possesses the properties of magnitude and equal intervals between adjacent units. Equal intervals between adjacent units means that there are equal amounts of the variable being measured between adjacent units on the scale. An example would be age. An increase in age from 21 to 22 would be the same as an increase in age from 60 to 61.\n**Kendall rank correlation**\n\nKendall rank correlation is a non-parametric test that measures the strength of dependence between two variables. If we consider two samples, a and b, where each sample size isn, we know that the total number of pairings with a b isn(n-1)/2. The following formula is used to calculate the value of Kendall rank correlation:\n\n![---n(n --- 1) ](media/Correlation-and-Covariance-image3.jpg)\n\nNc= number of concordant\n\nNd= Number of discordant\n**Key Terms**\n\n**Concordant:**Ordered in the same way.\n\n**Discordant:**Ordered differently.\n**Spearman rank correlation**\n\nSpearman rank correlation is a non-parametric test that is used to measure the degree of association between two variables. The Spearman rank correlation test does not carry any assumptions about the distribution of the data and is the appropriate correlation analysis when the variables are measured on a scale that is at least ordinal.\n\nThe following formula is used to calculate the Spearman rank correlation:\n![](media/Correlation-and-Covariance-image4.jpg)\nρ= Spearman rank correlation\n\ndi= the difference between the ranks of corresponding variables\n\nn= number of observations\n**Types of research questions a Spearman Correlation can examine**\n-   Is there a statistically significant relationship between participants' level of education (high school, bachelor's, or graduate degree) and their starting salary?\n-   Is there a statistically significant relationship between horse's finishing position a race and horse's age?\n**Assumptions**\n\nThe assumptions of the Spearman correlation are that data must be at least ordinal and the scores on one variable must be monotonically related to the other variable.\n**Key Terms**\n\n**Effect size**\n\nCohen's standard may be used to evaluate the correlation coefficient to determine the strength of the relationship, or the effect size. Correlation coefficients between .10 and .29 represent a small association, coefficients between .30 and .49 represent a medium association, and coefficients of .50 and above represent a large association or relationship.\n**Ordinal data**\n\nIn an ordinal scale, the levels of a variable are ordered such that one level can be considered higher/lower than another. However, the magnitude of the difference between levels is not necessarily known. An example would be rank ordering levels of education. A graduate degree is higher than a bachelor's degree, and a bachelor's degree is higher than a high school diploma. However, we cannot quantify how much higher a graduate degree is compared to a bachelor's degree. We also cannot say that the difference in education between a graduate degree and a bachelor's degree is the same as the difference between a bachelor's degree and a high school diploma.\n<http://www.statisticssolutions.com/correlation-pearson-kendall-spearman>\n\n<https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-calculate-nonparametric-rank-correlation-in-python>\n\n<https://towardsdatascience.com/clearly-explained-pearson-v-s-spearman-correlation-coefficient-ada2f473b8>\n\n<https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-a-correlation-coefficient-r-value-in-statistics-explains>\n\n## Covariance**\n\nCovariance is a measure of the joint variability of two variables\nCovariance can take on values from -inf to +inf. This is the problem as it is very hard to put such numbers into perspective\n\n![Sample covariance formula: s n---l Population covariance formula: In Excel, the covariance is calculated by: Sample covariance: -COVARIANCE-SO Population covariance. • -COVARIANCE-PO ](media/Correlation-and-Covariance-image5.jpg)\nLike the correlation, a positive covariance indicates that two variables move together, a zero covariance that there is no relationship between the two variables, and a negative covariance an indication that they move in opposite directions\n**Correlation doesn't equal Causation**\n\na.

We use standard deviations to scale our correlations so that it always stays between -1 and 1. This is our correlation coefficient, r.\n\nf.  Squared correlation coefficient - r^2^ is always between 0 and 1, and tells us - in decimal form - how much of the variance in one variable is predicted by the other.\n\ng.  Correlation doesn't equal causation\n\nh.  Spurious correlations: If two variables are correlated, we are often tempted to create elaborate explanations for why. In many cases, that correlation can be suprious, with the two variables that are correlated both driven by a third and often unseen variable\n\ni.  Past vs Future: The data that we use to estimate correlation come from the past, and past correlation is not always a predictor of future correlation\n**A Best Fit Line**\n\n![The Intercept: In the scatter plot, the intercept is where the best-fit line crosses the Y axis. In simple terms, it is the value that the Y variable has when the X variable is zero. The-Rsguared: This measures the how well the line fits the data. If the line is a perfect fit (every point is on it), the R squared will be one (as will the correlation). The Best Fit Line: In an ordinary-least-squares (OLS) regression, the best fit line is the one that minimizes the squared distances from the line. 14.0 12 10 8 6 The-Slope: The slope of the best fit line is also a measure of how changes in the X variable show up as changes in the Y variable.
