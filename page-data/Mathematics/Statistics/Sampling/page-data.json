As inclusion is determined by the analyst, it can be more difficult to extrapolate whether the sample accurately represents the larger population than when probability sampling is used.\nNonprobability data sampling methods include:\n-   Convenience sampling:Data is collected from an easily accessible and available group.\n-   Consecutive sampling:Data is collected from every subject that meets the criteria until the predetermined sample size is met.\n-   Purposive or judgmental sampling:The researcher selects the data to sample based on predefined criteria.\n-   Quota sampling:The researcher ensures equal representation within the sample for all subgroups in the data set or population.\nOnce generated, a sample can be used for[predictive analytics](https://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/definition/predictive-analytics). For example, a retail business might use data sampling to uncover patterns about customer behavior and[predictive modeling](https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/definition/predictive-modeling)to create more effective sales strategies.\n**Sample Size**\n\n![8000 points 2000 Points 500 Points ](media/Sampling-image1.jpeg)\n**Sampling Sins**\n-   Bias: The sample has to be representative of the population. If the sampling method creates bias, the results from the sample cannot be extrapolated to the population\n    -   Exclusion: Some parts of the population may not even make into the sampling universe\n    -   Self-selection: Some parts of the population may be more easily accessible than other parts, given how you collect data\n    -   Non-response: Some parts of the population may be less likely to respond to requests for data\n    -   Survivorship: Success (of failure, sometimes) may make an observation more likely to be sampled\n-   Noise: Even if the sample is representative, the results that you obtain will have statistical error or noise that can muddy your conclusions.\n**Why do we need sampling?**\n\n1.  **Practicality:** If the population is too large to collect data on, and/or a subset (small or large) of the population is inaccessible, you have no choice but to sample the data\n\n2.  **Costs:** Even if you could collect data on the entire population, the costs (in time and money) may outweigh the benefits of doing so\n\n3.  **Time trade off:** Related to the second point is the question of how frequently you want to update the data. It is easier to update sampled data than data on the entire population\n**Independence + Identical Distributions (ID) (IID)**\n-   In almost any discussion of sampling and statistics, the words independence and identical distributions thrown in as pre-requisites or at least good qualities in a sample\n    -   Independence: Events are independent when whether an event occurs or not is not determined by other events occuring\n        -   Coin tosses are a classic example of independence\n        -   Are stock price changes independent\n    -   Identical Distributions: Each event draws from the same probability distribution\n        -   Coin tosses draw from the same distribution\n        -   Do stock price changes draw from the same distribution\n-   In finance, researchers often assume independence and identical distributions, in making assertions based upon samples, but the truth is that both characteristics are hard to find\n**Stratified Random Sampling**\n\nIn the context of sampling,stratifiedmeans splitting the population into smaller groups or strata based on a characteristic. To put it another way, you divide a population into groups based on their features\nRandomsamplingentails randomly selecting subjects (entities) from a population. Each subject has an equal probability of being chosen from the population to form a sample (subpopulation) of the overall population\nSo therefore,stratified random samplingis a sampling approach in which the population is separated into groups or strata depending on a particular characteristic. Then subjects from each stratum (the singular of strata) are randomly sampled\nYou divide the population into groups based on a characteristic and then choose a subject or entity at random from each group\n**Types of Stratified Random Sampling**\n\nStratified sampling is divided into two categories, which are:\n-   **Proportionate stratified random sampling**\n-   **Disproportionate stratified random sampling**\n<https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-stratified-random-sampling-definition-and-python-example>\n\n","excerpt":"Sampling Created: 2021-10-02 14:33:50 +0500 Modified: 2022-11-23
