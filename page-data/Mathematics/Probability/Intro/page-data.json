Assigning events a[zero probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_probability)contravenes[Cromwell's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromwell%27s_rule); such contravention can never be strictly justified in physical situations, albeit sometimes must be assumed in practice.\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_succession>\n\n## Probability part 1 - Rules and Patterns**\n\na.
