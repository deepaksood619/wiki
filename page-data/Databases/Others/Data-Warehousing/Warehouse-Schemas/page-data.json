The schemas are designed to address the unique needs of very large databases designed for the analytical purpose (OLAP).\n**Types of Data Warehouse Schema**\n\nFollowing are 3 chief types of multidimensional schemas each having its unique advantages.\n-   Star Schema\n-   Snowflake Schema\n-   Galaxy Schema\n**What is a Star Schema?**\n\nIn theStar Schema, the center of the star can have one fact table and a number of associated dimension tables. It is known as star schema as its structure resembles a star. The star schema is the simplest type of Data Warehouse schema. It is also known as Star Join Schema and is optimized for querying large data sets.\n\n![Dimension Table Dealer Dealer_lD Location ID Country_ID Dealer NM Dealer CNTCT Dimension Table Branch Dim Branch ID Name Address Country Fact Table Revenue Dealer ID Model ID Branch_ID Date ID Units Sold Revenue Dimension Table Date Dim Date ID Year Month Quarter Date Dimension Table Product Product ID Product Name Model_lD Variant ID ](media/Data-Warehousing_Warehouse-Schemas-image1.png)\n**Example of Star Schema**\n\nFor example, as you can see in the above-given image that fact table is at the center which contains keys to every dimension table like Dealer_ID, Model ID, Date_ID, Product_ID, Branch_ID & other attributes like Units sold and revenue.\n**Characteristics of Star Schema**\n-   Every dimension in a star schema is represented with the only one-dimension table\n-   The dimension table should contain the set of attributes\n-   The dimension table is joined to the fact table using a foreign key\n-   The dimension table are not joined to each other\n-   Fact table would contain key and measure\n-   The Star schema is easy to understand and provides optimal disk usage\n-   The dimension tables arenot normalized. For instance, in the above figure, Country_ID does not have Country lookup table as an OLTP design would have\n-   The schema is widely supported by BI Tools\n[**https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/guidance/star-schema**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/guidance/star-schema)\n\n**Book -** The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Definitive Guide to Dimensional Modeling(3rd edition, 2013) by Ralph Kimball et al.\nStar schemais a mature modeling approach widely adopted by relational data warehouses. It requires modelers to classify their model tables as eitherdimensionorfact.\n**What is a Snowflake Schema?**\n\nA Snowflake Schema is an extension of a Star Schema, and it adds additional dimensions. It is called snowflake because its diagram resembles a Snowflake\nThe dimension tables arenormalizedwhich splits data into additional tables. In the following example, Country is further normalized into an individual table.\n\n![mens on a Location Location_ID R ion Dimension Table Country Country_ID Countr _ Name Dimension Table Dealer Dealer_1D Location_ID Country_ID Dealer NM Dealer_CNTCT Dimension Table Branch Dim Branch ID Name Add ress Country Fact Table Revenue Dealer ID Model ID Branch ID Date ID Un its_Sold Revenue Dimension Table Date Dim Date_lD Year Month Quarter Date Dimension Table Product Product_ID Product_Name Model_lD Variant_ID Dimension Table Variant Variant_lD Variant_Name Fuel type ](media/Data-Warehousing_Warehouse-Schemas-image2.png)\n**Characteristics of Snowflake Schema:**\n-   The main benefit of the snowflake schema it uses smaller disk space.\n-   Easier to implement a dimension is added to the Schema\n-   Due to multiple tables query performance is reduced\n-   The primary challenge that you will face while using the snowflake Schema is that you need to perform more maintenance efforts because of the more lookup tables.\n**Star Vs Snowflake Schema: Key Differences**\n\n| **Star Schema**                                                                                                        | **Snow Flake Schema**                                                                                             |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Hierarchies for the dimensions are stored in the dimensional table.                                                    | Hierarchies are divided into separate tables.                                                                     |\n| It contains a fact table surrounded by dimension tables.                                                               | One fact table surrounded by dimension table which are in turn surrounded by dimension table                      |\n| In a star schema, only single join creates the relationship between the fact table and any dimension tables.           | A snowflake schema requires many joins to fetch the data.                                                         |\n| Simple DB Design.                                                                                                      | Very Complex DB Design.                                                                                           |\n| Denormalized Data structure and query also run faster.                                                                 | Normalized Data Structure.                                                                                        |\n| High level of Data redundancy                                                                                          | Very low-level data redundancy                                                                                    |\n| Single Dimension table contains aggregated data.                                                                       | Data Split into different Dimension Tables.                                                                       |\n| Cube processing is faster.                                                                                             | Cube processing might be slow because of the complex join.                                                        |\n| Offers higher performing queries using Star Join Query Optimization.
