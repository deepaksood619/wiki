(24/4) x 14 / 2 = 35 RCUs\n**Calculating Writes (Writes)**\n\nA write capacity unitrepresents:\n-   one write per second,\n-   for an item up to 1 KB\n\nHow to calculateWrites\n\ni.  Round data up to nearest 1.\n\nii. Times by number of writes\n\nHere's an example:\n-   50 writes at 40KB per item. 40 x 50 = 2000 WCUs\n-   11 writes at 1KB per item. 1 x 11 = 11 WCUs\n-   18 writes at 500 BYTES per item. 1 x 18 = 18 WCUs\n**DynamoDB Accelerator**\n\nDynamoDB Accelerator(DAX)is afully managed in-memory write through cachefor DynamoDB that runs in a cluster\n-   Reads are eventually consistent\n-   Incoming requests are evenly distributed across all of the nodes in the cluster.\n-   DAX can reduce read response times tomicroseconds\nDAX is ideal for:\n-   fastest response times possible\n-   apps that read a small number of items more frequently\n-   apps that areread intensive\nDAX is not ideal for:\n-   Apps that require strongly consistent reads\n-   Apps that do not require microsecond read response times\n-   Apps that arewrite intensive, or that do not perform much read activity\n-   If you don't need DAXconsider using ElastiCache\n**DynamoDB Transactions**\n\nDynamoDB supports transactions via theTransactWriteItemsandTransactGetItemsAPI calls.\n\nTransactionslet you query multiple tables at once and are an all-or-nothing approach (all API calls must succeed).\n**Global tables**\n\nDynamoDB Global tables provide a fully managed solution for deployingmulti-region, multi-master databases.\n**Streams**\n\nDynamoDB Streamsallows you to set up a Lambda function triggered every time data is modified in a table to react to changes.Streams do not consume RCUs.\n**DynamoDB API**\n\nDynamoDB API's most notable commands via CLI: aws dynamodb < command >\naws dynamodbget-itemreturns a set of attributes for the item with the given primary key. If no matching item, then it does not return any data and there will be no Item element in the response.\n\naws dynamodbput-itemCreates a new item, or replaces an old item with a new item. If an item that has the same primary key as the new item already exists in the specified table, the new item completely replaces the existing item.\naws dynamodbupdate-itemEdits an existing item's attributes, or adds a new item to the table if it does not already exist.\naws dynamodbbatch-get-itemreturns the attributes of one or more items from one or more tables. You identify requested items by primary key. A single operation can retrieve up to16 MB of data, which can contain as many as100 items.\naws dynamodbbatch-write-itemputs or deletes multiple items in one or more tables. Can write up to16 MB of data, which can comprise as many as25 put or delete requests. Individual items to be written can beas large as 400 KB.\naws dynamodbcreate-tableadds a new table to your account. Table names must be unique within each Region.\naws dynamodbupdate-tableModifies the provisioned throughput settings, global secondary indexes, or DynamoDB Streams settings for a given table.\naws dynamodbdelete-tableoperation deletes a table and all of its items.\naws dynamodbtransact-get-itemsis a synchronous operation that atomically retrieves multiple items from one or more tables (but not from indexes) in a single account and Region. Call can contain up to25 objects. The aggregate size of the items in the transactioncannot exceed 4 MB.\naws dynamodbtransact-write-itemsa synchronous write operation that groups up to25 action requests. These actions can target items in different tables, but not in different AWS accounts or Regions, and no two actions can target the same item.\naws dynamodbqueryfinds items based on primary key values. You can query table or secondary index that has a composite primary key.\naws dynamodbscanreturns one or more items and item attributes by accessing every item in a table or a secondary index.\n<https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/ultimate-dynamodb-2020-cheatsheet>\n","excerpt":"Cheetsheet Created: 2020-03-14 13:39:48 +0500 Modified: 2020-07-22 13:39:47 +0500 The Basics of DynamoDB
