Dots or dashes are often used for multi-word fields, as in \"comment:1234:reply.to\" or \"comment:1234:reply-to\".\n-   The maximum allowed key size is 512 MB.\n**Redis Strings**\n\nValues can be strings (including binary data) of every kind, for instance you can store a jpeg image inside a value. A value can't be bigger than 512 MB.\nNote that[SET](https://redis.io/commands/set)will replace any existing value already stored into the key, in the case that the key already exists, even if the key is associated with a non-string value. So[SET](https://redis.io/commands/set)performs an assignment.\nThe[SET](https://redis.io/commands/set)command has interesting options, that are provided as additional arguments. For example, I may ask[SET](https://redis.io/commands/set)to fail if the key already exists, or the opposite, that it only succeed if the key already exists:\n\n> set mykey newval nx\n(nil)\n> set mykey newval xx\nOK\nEven if strings are the basic values of Redis, there are interesting operations you can perform with them. For instance, one is atomic increment:\n\n> set counter 100\nOK\n> incr counter\n(integer) 101\n> incr counter\n(integer) 102\n> incrby counter 50\n(integer) 152\nThe[INCR](https://redis.io/commands/incr)command parses the string value as an integer, increments it by one, and finally sets the obtained value as the new value. There are other similar commands like[INCRBY](https://redis.io/commands/incrby),[DECR](https://redis.io/commands/decr)and[DECRBY](https://redis.io/commands/decrby). Internally it's always the same command, acting in a slightly different way.\nWhat does it mean that INCR is atomic? That even multiple clients issuing INCR against the same key will never enter into a race condition. For instance, it will never happen that client 1 reads \"10\", client 2 reads \"10\" at the same time, both increment to 11, and set the new value to 11. The final value will always be 12 and the read-increment-set operation is performed while all the other clients are not executing a command at the same time.\nThere are a number of commands for operating on strings. For example the[GETSET](https://redis.io/commands/getset)command sets a key to a new value, returning the old value as the result. You can use this command, for example, if you have a system that increments a Redis key using[INCR](https://redis.io/commands/incr)every time your web site receives a new visitor. You may want to collect this information once every hour, without losing a single increment. You can[GETSET](https://redis.io/commands/getset)the key, assigning it the new value of \"0\" and reading the old value back.\n\nThe ability to set or retrieve the value of multiple keys in a single command is also useful for reduced latency. For this reason there are the[MSET](https://redis.io/commands/mset)and[MGET](https://redis.io/commands/mget)commands:\n\n> mset a 10 b 20 c 30\nOK\n> mget a b c\n1) \"10\"\n2) \"20\"\n3) \"30\"\n\nWhen[MGET](https://redis.io/commands/mget)is used, Redis returns an array of values.\n**Redis Expires**\n-   They can be set both using seconds or milliseconds precision.\n-   However the expire time resolution is always 1 millisecond.\n-   Information about expires are replicated and persisted on disk, the time virtually passes when your Redis server remains stopped (this means that Redis saves the date at which a key will expire).\n**How Redis expires keys**\n\nRedis keys are expired in two ways: a passive way, and an active way.\nA key is passively expired simply when some client tries to access it, and the key is found to be timed out.\nOf course this is not enough as there are expired keys that will never be accessed again.

Commands are logged using the same format as the Redis protocol itself, in an append-only fashion. Redis is able to rewrite the log in the background when it gets too big.\n-   If you wish, you can disable persistence completely, if you want your data to just exist as long as the server is running.\n-   It is possible to combine both AOF and RDB in the same instance. Notice that, in this case, when Redis restarts the AOF file will be used to reconstruct the original dataset since it is guaranteed to be the most complete.\n**AOF - Append Only File**\n\nIt's the change-log style persistent format.\n\nAOF is actually a persistence technique in which an RDB file is generated once and all the data is appended to it as it comes\n**RDB - Redis Database Backup**\n\nIt's the snapshot style persistence format.\n\nRDB file is a dump of all user data stored in an internal, compressed serialization format at a particular timestamp which is used for point-in-time recovery (recovery from a timestamp).\n**Compress AOF**\n\nBGREWRITEAOF\n<https://redis.io/commands/bgrewriteaof>\n<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39953542/aof-and-rdb-backups-in-redis>\n\n[**https://redis.io/topics/persistence**](https://redis.io/topics/persistence)\n\n<https://redislabs.com/ebook/part-2-core-concepts/chapter-4-keeping-data-safe-and-ensuring-performance/4-1-persistence-options>\n\n## Redis Keyspace Notifications**\n\nKeyspace notifications allow clients to subscribe to Pub/Sub channels in order to receive events affecting the Redis data set in some way.\nExamples of events that can be received are:\n-   All the commands affecting a given key.\n-   All the keys receiving an LPUSH operation.\n-   All the keys expiring in the database 0.\nEvents are delivered using the normal Pub/Sub layer of Redis, so clients implementing Pub/Sub are able to use this feature without modifications.\nBecause Redis Pub/Sub isfire and forgetcurrently there is no way to use this feature if your application demandsreliable notificationof events, that is, if your Pub/Sub client disconnects, and reconnects later, all the events delivered during the time the client was disconnected are lost.\nIn the future there are plans to allow for more reliable delivering of events, but probably this will be addressed at a more general level either bringing reliability to Pub/Sub itself, or allowing Lua scripts to intercept Pub/Sub messages to perform operations like pushing the events into a list.\n<https://redis.io/topics/notifications>\n","excerpt":"Redis Concepts Created: 2020-03-20
