We then have a process that checks for items that should be executed now, and if there are any, the process removes it from the*ZSET*, adding it to the proper*LIST*queue.\nWe can't wait/re-enqueue items as described in the first, because that'll waste the worker process's time. We also can't create a local waiting list as described in the second option, because if the worker process crashes for an unrelated reason, we lose any pending work items it knew about. We'll instead use a secondaryZSETas described in the third option, because it's simple, straightforward, and we can use a lock to ensure that the move is safe.\n**#
