It is also used to eliminate the undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies.\n-   Normalization divides the larger table into the smaller table and links them using relationship.\n-   The normal form is used to reduce redundancy from the database table.\n**Why Data Normalization?**\n\n1.  **Increased consistency.** Information is stored in one place and one place only, reducing the possibility of inconsistent data.\n\n2.  **Easier object-to-data mapping.** Highly-normalized data schemas in general are closer conceptually to object-oriented schemas because the object-oriented goals of promoting high cohesion and loose coupling between classes results in similar solutions (at least from a data point of view).\nYou typically want to have highly normalized operational data stores (ODSs) and data warehouses (DWs).\nThe primary disadvantage of normalization is slower reporting performance. You will want to have a[denormalized](http://agiledata.org/essays/dataNormalization.html#Denormalization)schema to support reporting, particularly in data marts.\n**Anamolies of DB**\n\n**Example:** Suppose a manufacturing company stores the employee details in a table named employee that has four attributes: emp_id for storing employee's id, emp_name for storing employee's name, emp_address for storing employee's address and emp_dept for storing the department details in which the employee works. At some point of time the table looks like this:\n\n| emp_id | emp_name | emp_address | emp_dept |\n|--------|----------|-------------|----------|\n| 101    | Rick     | Delhi       | D001     |\n| 101    | Rick     | Delhi       | D002     |\n| 123    | Maggie   | Agra        | D890     |\n| 166    | Glenn    | Chennai     | D900     |\n| 166    | Glenn    | Chennai     | D004     |\n\nThe above table is not normalized. We will see the problems that we face when a table is not normalized.\n**Update anomaly:** In the above table we have two rows for employee Rick as he belongs to two departments of the company. If we want to update the address of Rick then we have to update the same in two rows or the data will become inconsistent. If somehow, the correct address gets updated in one department but not in other then as per the database, Rick would be having two different addresses, which is not correct and would lead to inconsistent data.\n**Insert anomaly:** Suppose a new employee joins the company, who is under training and currently not assigned to any department then we would not be able to insert the data into the table if emp_dept field doesn't allow nulls.\n**Delete anomaly:** Suppose, if at a point of time the company closes the department D890 then deleting the rows that are having emp_dept as D890 would also delete the information of employee Maggie since she is assigned only to this department.\n**Normalization**\n-   First normal form(1NF)\n-   Second normal form(2NF)\n-   Third normal form(3NF)\n-   Boyce & Codd normal form (BCNF)\n-   Fourth normal form (4NF)\n-   Fifth normal form (5NF)\n**First Normal Form (1NF)**\n\nAn attribute (column) of a table cannot hold multiple values. It should hold only atomic values.\nSample Employee table, it displays employees are working with multiple departments.\n\n| Employee | Age | Department        |\n|----------|-----|-------------------|\n| Melvin   | 32  | Marketing, Sales  |\n| Edward   | 45  | Quality Assurance |\n| Alex     | 36  | Human Resource    |\nEmployee table following 1NF:\n\n| Employee | Age | Department        |\n|----------|-----|-------------------|\n| Melvin   | 32  | Marketing         |\n| Melvin   | 32  | Sales             |\n| Edward   | 45  | Quality Assurance |\n| Alex     | 36  | Human Resource    |\n**Second Normal Form (2NF)**\n-   Should be in 1NF\n-   All non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key\nSample Products table:\n\n| productID | product    | Brand   |\n|-----------|------------|---------|\n| 1         | Monitor    | Apple   |\n| 2         | Monitor    | Samsung |\n| 3         | Scanner    | HP      |\n| 4         | Head phone | JBL     |\nProduct table following 2NF:\n\nProducts Category table:\n\n| productID | product    |\n|-----------|------------|\n| 1         | Monitor    |\n| 2         | Scanner    |\n| 3         | Head phone |\n\nBrand table:\n\n| brandID | brand   |\n|---------|---------|\n| 1       | Apple   |\n| 2       | Samsung |\n| 3       | HP      |\n| 4       | JBL     |\n\nProducts Brand table:\n\n| pbID | productID | brandID |\n|------|-----------|---------|\n| 1    | 1         | 1       |\n| 2    | 1         | 2       |\n| 3    | 2         | 3       |\n| 4    | 3         | 4       |\n![Second Normal Form (2NF)](media/Normalization-image1.png)\n**Third Normal Form (3NF)**\n-   Should be already in 2NF\n-   No transition dependency exists\n\nno column entry should be dependent on any other entry (value) other than the key for the table.\n\nIf such an entity exists, move it outside into a new table.\n**Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**\n\n3NF and all tables in the database should be only one primary key.\nIt is an advance version of 3NF that's why it is also referred as 3.5NF.
