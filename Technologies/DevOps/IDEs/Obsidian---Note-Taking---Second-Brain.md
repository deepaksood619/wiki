## Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) / Second Brain

Personal knowledge management(PKM) is a process of collecting information that a person uses to gather, classify, store, search, retrieve and share [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge) in their daily activities ([Grundspenkis 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management#CITEREFGrundspenkis2007)) and the way in which these processes support work activities ([Wright 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management#CITEREFWright2005)). It is a response to the idea that [knowledge workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker) need to be responsible for their own growth and learning ([Smedley 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management#CITEREFSmedley2009)). It is a bottom-up approach to [knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management)(KM) ([Pollard 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management#CITEREFPollard2008)).

## Different levels of knowledge

- **Level 1: Having something (Information)**--- a lot of our digital information falls into this category. You have the ability to go find what you're looking for when you need it, but you have to first think about it before you can locate it. If you have a video course that you bought but haven't gone through yet, that would fall into this category.
- **Level 2: Understanding something (Revelation)**--- this is being able to recall something without having to look it up. At this level, you've internalized the information and are starting to make connections, but it hasn't necessarily changed how you act.
- **Level 3: Doing something (Application)**--- this is where you start to see the result of the information you've collected. You don't just have it or understand it, it's changing your day-to-day actions. This is the first level where there is actual, visible output from the information that you've collected.

## Zettlekasten

Thezettelkasten(German: "slip box", pluralzettelkästen) is a system of [note-taking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note-taking) and [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) used in research and study.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten>

<https://zettelkasten.de/introduction>

a Zettelkasten needs to adhere to the [Principle of Atomicity](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/create-zettel-from-reading-notes/). That means that each Zettel only contains one unit of knowledge and one only.
