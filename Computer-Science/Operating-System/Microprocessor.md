# Multilevel Machine Architecture

![Level 5 Level 4 Level 3 Level 2 Level 1 Level O Problem-oriented language level Translation (compiler) Assembly language level Translation (assembler) Operating system machine level Partial interpretation (operating system) Instruction set architecture level Interpretation (microprogram) or direct execution Microarchitecture level Hardware Digital logic level Figure 1-2. A six-level computer. The support method for each level is indicat- ed below it (along with the name of the supporting program). ](media/Microprocessor-image1.png){width="4.5in" height="4.09375in"}

**Two types of CPU architecture**

1.  RISC Architecture

2.  CISC Architecture



**RISC & CISC Comparison**

![CISC It is prominent on Hardware It has high cycles per second It has transistors used for storing Instructions which are complex LOAD and STORE memory-to-memory is induced in instructions It has multi-clock RISC It is prominent on the Software It has low cycles per second More transistors are used for storing memory LOAD and STORE register-register are independent It has a single - clock ](media/Microprocessor-image5.jpg){width="5.0in" height="1.9375in"}
