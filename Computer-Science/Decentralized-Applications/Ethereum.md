Ethereum is a**decentralized platform** that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.
Uses Solidity as a programming language.
Ethereum's mechanism to choose the most valid chain is called the "GHOST protocol". GHOST stands for "Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree". Essentially, it picks the path that has had the most computation done on it. The protocol uses the block number of the most recent block, this represents the total number of blocks in the current path. The higher the block number, the longer the path and as such the larger the mining effort that had to have gone into arriving at the most recent block. This allows the network to agree on the correct version of the current state.-  Ethereum Virtual Machine is a decentralized virtual machine that can run crypto economically secured bits of code called smart contract.

- The smart contracts language Solidity is tailored to the ethereum blockchain since it compiles down to bytecode specific for Ethereum's stack machine.
- Solidity is Turing-complete meaning it can theoretically any kind of computation.

## Blinkist - Ethereum by Henning Diedrich**

- blockchain - secure and shared database that contains transactions
- smart contracts
- bitcoin
- ethereum - most advanced blockchain available
- The first block of data is called the genesis block
- Decentralized
- Blockchains will be to finance what the Internet was to music and video
- Consensus protocol known as proof-of-work
- Agree on true version of the blockchain
- Follow the longest chain or heaviest chain
- Problems
  - Loss of data
  - Confidentiality
- Ethereum is the blockchain of blockchains
