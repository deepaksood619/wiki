1.  Adjacency Matrix

2.  Adjacency List

Graph types -

1.  Sparse graph

2.  Dense graph
![In practice. Use adjacency-lists representation. Algorithms based on iterating over vertices adjacent to v. â€¢ Real-world graphs tend to be sparse. huge number of vertices, small average vertex degree representation list of edges adjacency matrix adjacency lists space E+V add edge edge between v and w? degree(v) iterate over vertices adjacent to v? v deg ree(v) * disallows parallel edges ](media/Intro-image2.png)
